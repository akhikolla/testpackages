
# adpss 0.1.1

## New features

  - An approximate inference procedure which computes a median unbiased
    estimate and confidence limits was added to the functions,
    `adaptive_analysis_norm_local` and `adaptive_analysis_norm_global`.

## Corrections

  - The error in testing the null hypothesis of the function
    `adaptive_analysis_norm_local` was corrected.

# adpss 0.1.0

## New release

  - Only test statistics with normality and independent and stationary
    increments are supported.

  - Locally and globally efficient adaptive test can be performed.

  - Calculation of P-value, median unbiased estimate and confidence
    limits is available only for globally efficient design.
