Dec 2020 Version 2.4.2
* Vignette added


Oct 2020 Version 2.4.1
* Minor change - replaced Gamma with Lambda for consistency with extBIC parameterisation. 
                 I did this previously but missed a couple of the changes. 


Aug  2020 Version 2.4
* Fixed bug in plotting function in OpenGUI
* Improved look of PlotAM
* Added interactive option to PlotAM to give users the option of saving the plot to file. 


July  2020 Version 2.3
* Changed gamma parameter in AM function to lambda parameter to be consistent with extBIC parameterisation. 
* Added plot function PlotAM. This capability was in the GUI but not as a function. 
* Added extra table of summary information to SummaryAM function
* Fixed bug in plotting function in GUI


March 2020 Version 2.2
* Added ability to read vcf files to ReadMarker function. 
* Revised SummaryAM to also calculate and report  allelic effect sizes
* Significant (order of magnitude) improvement in speed to FPR4AM (used for finding an optimal gamma 
 for the model building process)
* Changed home screen in OpenGUI app because Eagel workflow has changed. 
* Added Bioinformatics citation for Eagle package



Nov 2019 Version 2.1.1
* Fixed bug introduced by last change in ReadMap function.


Nov 2019 Version 2.1.0
* Continued improvement of handling of missing data. 
* Better handling of errors by OpenGUI. Previously, app would crash if an read error was encountered.  


Nov 2019 Version 2.0.0  
* Major update of Eagle. 
* Significant performance improvements, with at least a 50% increase in speed. 
* Also fixed several issues associated with the Z matrix.
* Improved handling of missing data. 

Aug 2019 Version 1.5.2 
* Minor change 
* Noalias feature in cpp code fixed. 

May 2019 Version 1.5.1 
* Minor change to GUI. 
* GUI made  more robust and removed library calls. 
* Havent been able to solve the mysterious uv_write errors that are written to the R consul when GUI is run. The errors are intermittent and random but have no effect on performance or the analysis. 

May 2019 Version 1.5.0 
* Major update to GUI. 
* A plotting page has been add. Users can now examine the change in score statistic (used for identifying the next "best" SNP to enter the model), across a chromosome or genome. This can be done for each step of the model building process. 

April 2019 Version 1.4.0 
* Modified SummaryAM to work with Z matrix. 

Feb 2019 Version 1.3.0 
* Fixed missing data issue with FPR4AM where it would crash if the trait contained missing data.

Nov 2018 Version 1.2.0 
* Modified FPR4AM so that it will give the best gamma value for a user-defined false positive rate, trait, and analysis model.
