2016-07-01  Roberto Bertolusso  <rbertolusso@rice.edu>

        * Release 0.99.17

        * All files need to be downloaded, as SEC has moved from
          http to https and xml2 does not know how to handle
          https protocol. xbrlDoAll will specify a default
          cache directory (xbrl.Cache) if none is provided.
          Downloaded instance and related files are deleted
          by default after processing, to mantain same
          previous functionality.
