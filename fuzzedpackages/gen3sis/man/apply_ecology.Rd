\title{Allows the user to define the ecological consequences for species within each site,
defining thus species survival and abundance}
\usage{
apply_ecology(abundance, traits, local_environment, config)
}
\arguments{
\item{abundance}{a named vector of abundances with one abundance value per species}

\item{traits}{a named matrix containing the species traits, one row per species}

\item{local_environment}{the environmental values for the given site}

\item{config}{the config of the simulation}
}
\value{
an abundance vector with the new abundance values for every species.
An abundance value of 0 indicates species death, any other values indicates survival.
}
\description{
Allows the user to define the ecological consequences for species within each site,
defining thus species survival and abundance
}
\details{
The arguments of the function allows to apply abiotic and biotic ecological rules to species in each 
site. Based on those rules, the function updates the abundance of each species in each site. If the abundance 
is null, the species is absent or extinct. Ecology can account for local environmental conditions, the abundance of
species, and/or their traits.
