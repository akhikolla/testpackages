\title{Allows the user to generates dispersal value(s) for a given species. The simulation request the user 
to return a vector of dispersal values with length specified by the num_draws parameter}
\usage{
get_dispersal_values(num_draws, species, landscape, config)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_draws}{the number of dispersal values drawn}

\item{species}{the species for which the values are to be produced}

\item{landscape}{the landscape of the current time step}

\item{config}{the config of the simulation}
}
\value{
a numerical vector of length num_draws with dispersal values
}
\description{
Allows the user to generates dispersal value(s) for a given species. The simulation request the user 
to return a vector of dispersal values with length specified by the num_draws parameter
}
\details{
Dispersal values are used for two different operations. 
First, for colonization, dispersal values are used to evaluate pairwise dispersal
events between colonized and uninhabited sites. 
Second, for geographic clustering, dispersal values are used during the clustering of
species populations when determining which sites 
are in range of each other and belong to the same geographic cluster.

num_draws tells the user how many dispersal values are requested by the simulation when this function is called and must 
be returned. It can be of varying length depending on the operation calling it, i.e. colonization or geographic clustering. 
If the dispersal is considered as fixed the function should return a vector of length num_draws with repeated identical
values, or varying values in case of more complex dispersal kernels.

Note: if the distances are randomized the cluster formation may be asymmetrical. Therefore the ordering of all
clustering operations is randomized.
