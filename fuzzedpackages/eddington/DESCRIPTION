Description: Compute a cyclist's Eddington number, including efficiently
    computing cumulative E over a vector. A cyclist's Eddington number
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Eddington_number_for_cycling>
    is the maximum number satisfying the condition such that a cyclist has
    ridden E miles or greater in E days. The algorithm in this package is an
    improvement over the conventional approach because both summary statistics
    and cumulative statistics can be computed in linear time, since it does not
    require initial sorting of the data. These functions may also be used for
    computing h-indices for authors, a metric described by Hirsch (2005)
    <doi:10.1073/pnas.0507655102>. Both are specific applications of computing
    the side length of a Durfee square 
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durfee_square>.
