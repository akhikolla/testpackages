volume="24",
number="2",
pages="225--232",
abstract="Two of the prime open-source environments available for machine/statistical learning in data mining and knowledge discovery are the software packages Weka and R which have emerged from the machine learning and statistics communities, respectively. To make the different sets of tools from both environments available in a single unified system, an R package RWeka is suggested which interfaces Weka's functionality to R. With only a thin layer of (mostly R) code, a set of general interface generators is provided which can set up interface functions with the usual ``R look and feel'', re-using Weka's standardized interface of learner classes (including classifiers, clusterers, associators, filters, loaders, savers, and stemmers) with associated methods.",
