\title{Training function of Sparse Additive Models}
\usage{
samQL(X, y, p = 3, lambda = NULL, nlambda = NULL,
  lambda.min.ratio = 0.005, thol = 1e-05, max.ite = 1e+05,
  regfunc = "L1")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The \code{n} by \code{d} design matrix of the training set, where \code{n} is sample size and \code{d} is dimension.}

\item{y}{The \code{n}-dimensional response vector of the training set, where \code{n} is sample size.}

\item{p}{The number of basis spline functions. The default value is 3.}

\item{lambda}{A user supplied lambda sequence. Typical usage is to have the program compute its own lambda sequence based on nlambda and lambda.min.ratio. Supplying a value of lambda overrides this. WARNING: use with care. Do not supply a single value for lambda. Supply instead a decreasing sequence of lambda values. samQL relies on its warms starts for speed, and its often faster to fit a whole path than compute a single fit.}

\item{nlambda}{The number of lambda values. The default value is 30.}

\item{lambda.min.ratio}{Smallest value for lambda, as a fraction of lambda.max, the (data derived) entry value (i.e. the smallest value for which all coefficients are zero). The default is 5e-3.}

\item{thol}{Stopping precision. The default value is 1e-5.}

\item{max.ite}{The number of maximum iterations. The default value is 1e5.}

\item{regfunc}{A string indicating the regularizer. The default value is "L1". You can also assign "MCP" or "SCAD" to it.}
}
\value{
\item{p}{
  The number of basis spline functions used in training.
}
\item{X.min}{
  A vector with each entry corresponding to the minimum of each input variable. (Used for rescaling in testing)
}
\item{X.ran}{
  A vector with each entry corresponding to the range of each input variable. (Used for rescaling in testing)
}
\item{lambda}{
  A sequence of regularization parameter used in training.
}
\item{w}{
  The solution path matrix (\code{d*p} by length of \code{lambda}) with each column corresponding to a regularization parameter. Since we use the basis expansion, the length of each column is \code{d*p+1}.
}
\item{intercept}{
  The solution path of the intercept.
}
\item{df}{
  The degree of freedom of the solution path (The number of non-zero component function)
}
\item{knots}{
  The \code{p-1} by \code{d} matrix. Each column contains the knots applied to the corresponding variable.
}
\item{Boundary.knots}{
  The \code{2} by \code{d} matrix. Each column contains the boundary points applied to the corresponding variable.
}
\item{func_norm}{
  The functional norm matrix (\code{d} by length of \code{lambda}) with each column corresponds to a regularization parameter. Since we have \code{d} input variables, the length of each column is \code{d}.
}
\item{sse}{
  Sums of square errors of the solution path.
}
}
\description{
The regression model is learned using training data.
}
\details{
We adopt various computational algorithms including the block coordinate descent, fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm, and newton method. The computation is further accelerated by "warm-start" and "active-set" tricks.

\examples{

## generating training data
n = 100
d = 500
X = 0.5*matrix(runif(n*d),n,d) + matrix(rep(0.5*runif(n),d),n,d)

## generating response
y = -2*sin(X[,1]) + X[,2]^2-1/3 + X[,3]-1/2 + exp(-X[,4])+exp(-1)-1

## Training
out.trn = samQL(X,y)
out.trn

## plotting solution path
plot(out.trn)

## generating testing data
nt = 1000
Xt = 0.5*matrix(runif(nt*d),nt,d) + matrix(rep(0.5*runif(nt),d),nt,d)

yt = -2*sin(Xt[,1]) + Xt[,2]^2-1/3 + Xt[,3]-1/2 + exp(-Xt[,4])+exp(-1)-1

## predicting response
out.tst = predict(out.trn,Xt)
