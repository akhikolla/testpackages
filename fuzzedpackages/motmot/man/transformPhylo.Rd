\item{phy}{An object of class \code{phylo} (see \pkg{ape}).}

\item{model}{The model of trait evolution (see details).}

\item{y}{A matrix of trait values.}

\item{nodeIDs}{Integer - ancestral nodes of clades.}

\item{rateType}{If model="clade", a vector specifying if rate shift occurs in a clade ("clade") or on the single branch leading to a clade ("branch").}

\item{branchRates}{Numeric vector specifying relative rates for individual branches}

\item{cladeRates}{Numeric vector specifying telative rates for clades or logical to indicate scalar is included in the 'modeslice' model (the scalar is included in the mode.param argument with the 'modeslice' model).}

}
\description{
Transforms the branch lengths of a phylo object according to a model of trait evolution (see details).
}
\details{
Transforms the branch lengths of a phylo object according to one of the following models:
\itemize{
 \item {model="bm"}- Brownian motion (constant rates random walk)
 \item {model="kappa"} - fits Pagel's kappa by raising all branch lengths to the power kappa. As kappa approaches zero, trait change becomes focused at branching events. For complete phylogenies, if kappa approaches zero this infers speciational trait change. 
 \item {model="lambda"} - fits Pagel's lambda to estimate phylogenetic signal by multiplying all internal branches of the tree by lambda, leaving tip branches as their original length (root to tip distances are unchanged);
 \item {model="delta"} - fits Pagel's delta by raising all node depths to the power delta. If delta <1, trait evolution is concentrated early in the tree whereas if delta >1 trait evolution is concentrated towards the tips. Values of delta above one can be difficult to fit reliably.
 \item {model="free"} - fits Mooer's et al's (1999) free model where each branch has its own rate of trait evolution. This can be a useful exploratory analysis but it is slow due to the number of parameters, particularly for large trees.
 \item {model="clade"} - fits a model where particular clades are a priori hypothesised to have different rates of trait evolution (see O'Meara et al. 2006; Thomas et al. 2006, 2009). Clades are specified using nodeIDs and are defined as the mrca node. Unique rates for each clade are specified using cladeRates. rateType specifies whether the rate shift occurs in the stem clade or on the single branch leading to the clade.
 \item {model="OU"} - fits an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model - a random walk with a central tendency proportional to alpha. High values of alpha can be interpreted as evidence of evolutionary constraints, stabilising selection or weak phylogenetic signal.
 \item {model="psi"} - fits a model to assess to the relative contributions of speciation and gradual evolution to a trait's evolutionary rate (Ingram 2010). Note that 'original nodes' from the full phylogeny can be included as an element on the phylogeny (e.g., phy$orig.node) as well as estimates of 'hidden' speciation (e.g., phy$hidden.speciation) if estimates of extinction (mu) are > 0.
\item {model="multiPsi"} {fits a model to assess to the relative contributions of speciation and gradual evolution to a trait's evolutionary rate but allows seperate values of psi fitted to seperate branches (Ingram 2010; Ingram et al. 2016). Note that 'original nodes' from the full phylogeny can be included as an element on the phylogeny (e.g., phy$orig.node) as well as estimates of 'hidden' speciation (e.g., phy$hidden.speciation) if estimates of extinction (mu) are > 0.}
\item {model="ACDC"} {fits a model to in which rates can exponentially increased or decrease through time (Blomberg et al. 2003). If the upper bound is < 0, the model is equivalent to the 'Early Burst' model of Harmon et al. 2010. If a nodeIDs is supplied, the model will fit a ACDC model nested within a clade, with a BM fit to the rest of the tree.}
\item {model="timeSlice"} {A model in which all branch rates change at time(s) in the past.}
\item {model="modeSlice"} {A model in which all branch modes change at a time or times set a priori by the user.}
 }
