Description: The algorithm assigns rareness/ outlierness score to every sample in voluminous datasets.
    The algorithm makes multiple estimations of the proximity between a pair of samples, in low-dimensional spaces. To compute proximity, FiRE uses Sketching, a variant of locality sensitive hashing.
