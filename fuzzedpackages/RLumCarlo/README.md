# RLumCarlo <img width=120px src="man/figures/Logo_RLumCarlo.png" align="right" />

The **R** package RLumCarlo provides a collection of R functions
modelling luminescence production in isolators and semiconductors for
various stimulation modes using Monte Carlo methods.

## Installation

#### i. Requirements

Depending on your OS please download and install one of the following:

-   *Windows*: [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
    (provided by CRAN)
-   *macOS*: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com) (provided by Apple)
-   *Linux*: [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) often comes pre-installed in
    most distributions. Should [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) be not
    available, however, we kindly refer to the exhaustive collection of
    installation guides depending on the Linux distribution.

#### ii. Install the package from GitHub

``` r
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/RLumCarlo@master")
```

## Examples

``` r
run_MC_CW_IRSL_TUN(A = 0.12, rho = 0.003, times = 0:1000) %>%
     plot_RLumCarlo(norm = TRUE, legend = TRUE)
```

## <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-euro"></span> Funding

The [development of RLumCarlo](https://github.com/R-Lum/RLumCarlo)
benefited from the support by various funding bodies:

-   The initial work by Johannes Friedrich, Sebastian Kreutzer and
    Christoph Schmidt was supported by the [DFG (2015–2018, SCHM
    3051/4-1, “Modelling quartz luminescence signal dynamics relevant
    for dating and dosimetry”, SCHM
    3051/4-1)](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/279969851).

-   Later financial support was secured through the project *‘ULTIMO:
    Unifying Luminescence Models of quartz and feldspar (German Academic
    Exchange Service) DAAD: Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst DAAD
    PPP USA 2018, ID: 57387041)’*.

-   The work of Sebastian Kreutzer as maintainer of the package was
    supported by [LabEx LaScArBx (ANR -
    n. ANR-10-LABX-52)](https://lascarbx.labex.u-bordeaux.fr) between
    2017 and 2019.

-   From 2020, Sebastian Kreutzer received funding from the European
    Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the
    Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 844457 (project: CREDit).
