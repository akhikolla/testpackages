## RLumCarlo 0.1.7 (2020-12-10)

*This package version needs at least R &gt;= 3.5.0.*

-   Update internal tests to function properly with `testthat >= 3.0.0`
-   Correct several code-documentation mismatches (thanks to an
    anonymous R Journal reviewer)

# RLumCarlo 0.1.6 (2020-07-05)

-   The last update to prevent the failed checks for the Solaris
    platform on CRAN came with unwanted side effects. After the compiler
    complained about `pow(<int>,<int>)`, we used `<double>` for all
    objects. Unfortunately, this led to complete wrong simulation
    results we did not detect during the tests before the submission.
    This issue was solved.

-   The package now has a central C++ header file defining functions and
    constants used in the other files. This change has no user-visible
    effect.

    `R`.
