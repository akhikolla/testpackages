        prediction model based on fuzzy logic.

Description: This is an evolutionary algorithm for fuzzy systems, a
        genetic algorithm is used to construct a fuzzy system able to
        fit the given training data.  This fuzzy system can then be
        used as a prediction model, it's composed of fuzzy logic rules
        that provide a good lingustic representation.
