 * Project:  stkpp::STKernel
 * Purpose:  Primary include file for the STKernel project.
 * Author:   Serge Iovleff, S..._Dot_I..._At_stkpp_Dot_org (see copyright for ...)
 **/

/** @file STKernel.h
 *  @brief This file include all the header files of the project STKernel.
 **/

/** @defgroup STKernel Kernel tools
 *  @brief The STKernel project is the low-level core library that forms the
 *  basis of the project. It provides data class handling for C++.
 *  It contains the sub-projects:
 *  - @ref Base
 *  - @ref Functors
 **/

/** @ingroup STKernel
 *  @defgroup Base Fundamental data types
 *  @brief In this subproject we define the fundamental types.
 *  The Base subproject is composed of
 * <ul>
 * <li> the standard types for handling data:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> String  for string data  </li>
 *   <li> Integer for discrete data </li>
 *   <li> Real    for quantitative data  </li>
 *   <li> Binary  for binary data in {0,1}   </li>
 *   <li> Sign    for signed data in {-1, 1}  </li>
 *   <li> Range   for contiguous range of Index in Arrays  </li>
 * </ul>
 * For all these types, a not available special value is defined which can be
 * displayed in a transparent way using proxy classes @sa Proxy, @sa Proxy.
 * <li> standard input and output streams for all these types </li>
 * <li> a standard Runtime-type identification mechanism (RTTI) @sa IdType,
 * @sa IdTypeImpl </li>
 * <li> and miscellaneous utilities functions </li>
 * </ul>
 **/

/** @ingroup STKernel
 *  @defgroup Functors Functors
 *  In the Functors subproject, we implement the main functors that can be used
 *  throughout the STK++ project, especially in the Arrays project.
 **/

/** @ingroup Base
 *  @defgroup Arithmetic Arithmetic properties.
 *
 *  These classes extend the @c numeric_limits C++ struct. They
 *  allow to handle in a transparent way a possible
 *  Not Available (NA) value in the data.
 **/

/** @ingroup Base
 *  @defgroup RTTI Runtime Type Identification.
 *
 *  These classes allow to handle the Runtime type identification (RTTI)
 *  problem and are useful when working with heterogeneous data.
 **/

/** @ingroup Base
 *  @defgroup iostream I/O stream declarations
 *
 *  Nearly all of the I/O classes are parameterized on the type of
 *  characters they read and write (The major exception is ios_base at
 *  the top of the hierarchy).
 *
 *  For ease of use, all of the basic_* I/O-related
 *  classes are given typedef names in the namespace STK. For example:
 *
 *  @code
 *     typedef basic_ifstream<Char>  ifstream;
 *  @endcode
 *  These declarations in the STK namespace would be very useful if you
 *  modify the built-in type representation of Char (say wchar_t).
 **/

/** @ingroup STKernel
 *  @namespace STK::Base
 *  @brief the namespace Base contain all the internal stuff needed by the STK++
 *  fundamental types.
