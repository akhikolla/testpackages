/**
 * @defgroup Regress Regression
 * @brief The project Regress proposes a set of classes for computing usual
 * linear and non-linear regressions.
 *
 * In statistics, regression analysis includes any techniques for modeling and
 * analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a
 * set of dependent variables and one or more independent variables. More
 * specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical values
 * of the dependent variables changes when any one of the independent variables
 * is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Most
 * commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the
 * dependent variables given the independent variables â€” that is, the average
 * value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are held
 * fixed.
 *
 * In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the variation
 * of the dependent variables around the regression function, which can be
 * described by a probability distribution.
 *
 * Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its
 * use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. Regression
 * analysis is also used to understand which among the independent variables are
 * related to the dependent variable, and to explore the forms of these
 * relationships. In restricted circumstances, regression analysis can be used
 * to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent
 * variables.
 *
 * A large body of techniques for carrying out regression analysis has been
 * developed. Familiar methods such as linear regression and ordinary least
 * squares regression are parametric, in that the regression function is defined
 * in terms of a finite number of unknown parameters that are estimated from the
 * data. Nonparametric regression refers to techniques that allow the regression
 * function to lie in a specified set of functions, which may be
 * infinite-dimensional.

 *  project.
 *  In mathematics, a basis function is an element of a particular basis for a
 *  function space. Every continuous function in the function space can be represented
 *  as a linear combination of basis functions, just as every vector in a vector space
 *  can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors.
