/** @defgroup Algebra Algebra
 *  @brief The Algebra project provides structures, tools and methods of the
 *  usual algebra techniques.
 *
 * The Algebra project proposes some set of template function for computing
 * dot product,  weighted dot product, vector norm, weighted vector norm
 * and so on... It implement also linear algebra methods for the ArrayXX
 * and the ArraySquareX classes:
 *    @li The Qr decomposition of an arbitrary matrix of Real, @sa Qr
 *    @li The svd decomposition of an arbitrary matrix of real, @sa Svd
 *    @li An Eigenvalue decomposition for symmetric (square) matrices and a
 *    generalized inverse method for such matrices, @sa SymEigen.
*    @li methods for solving the linear least square problem.
 *
 * It proposes also some set of method for performing
 * @li Givens rotations on a matrix
 * @li GramSchmidt orthogonalization of the columns of a matrix/array
 * @li Householder rotations of an array/matrix.
 * @li Cholesky decomposition.
