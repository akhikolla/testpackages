/**
 * @defgroup Arrays Arrays and Expressions
 * @brief The Arrays project provides two kinds of arrays for storing
 * in a two entries arrays (matrices) numeric data.
 *
 * All the containers you can used in order to stored numeric values are
 * template by the Type of numeric value you want to use. Some predefined type
 * have been defined for the Real and the arithmetic cases.
 *
 * There is two kind of containers that have been defined and implemented in the
 * STK++ project:
 * @li the set of arrays: Array2D, Array2DSquare, Array2DVector (column oriented
 * vectors), Array2DPoint (row oriented vector), Array2DUpperTriangular,
 * Array2DLowerTriangular, Array2DDiagonal allowing to modify, resize, add,
 * remove rows/columns in a very flexible way.
 * @li the set of Arrays: CArray, CArrayPoint, CarrayVector that can be used
 * as C-like containers (as theirs names indicate).
 *
 * Moreover a Meta-template mechanism (lazy evaluation) for optimization of
 * complex expressions at compile time is available. It is possible to mix any
 * kind of array in such expressions.
