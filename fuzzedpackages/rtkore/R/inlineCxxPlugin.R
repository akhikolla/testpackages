# plugins are functions that return a list with :
#
# includes
# mandatory. it is included at the top of the compiled file by cxxfunction
#
# body
# optional. a function that takes one argument (the body of the c++ function)
# and returned a modified version of the body. The "Rcpp" plugin uses this to
# surround the code with the BEGIN_RCPP and END_RCPP macros
#
# LinkingTo
# optional. character vector containing the list of packages that the code
# needs to link to. This adds the include path of the given packages. The "Rcpp"
# and "RcppArmadillo" plugins use this.
#
# env
# optional. named list of environment variables. For example, the "Rcpp"
# plugin uses this to add Rcpp user library to the PKG_LIBS environment variable.
#
#
# plugins can be manually registered using the registerPlugin function.
# Alternatively, a package may supply an inline plugin implicitely by defining a
# function called inlineCxxPlugin, which does not necessarily need to be
# exported from the namespace of the package.
#
# This is the implementtion of the inlineCxxPlugin function distributed with Rcpp.
# It allows to link with rtkore in an inlined c++ function.
#
# example
# helloWorld <- cppFunction("void helloWorld() {std::cout << \"hello World\";}",depends="rtkore")
#
inlineCxxPlugin <- function()
{
includes <- "
#include <RTKpp.h>
#ifndef BEGIN_RCPP
#define BEGIN_RCPP
#endif

#ifndef END_RCPP
#define END_RCPP
#endif

using namespace Rcpp;
using namespace STK;
"
