Description: Parametric spatial split-population (SP) survival models for clustered 
    event processes. The models account for structural and spatial heterogeneity among 
    “at risk” and “immune” populations, and incorporate time-varying covariates. 
    This package currently implements Weibull, Exponential and Log-logistic forms for 
    the duration component. It also includes functions for a series of diagnostic 
    tests and plots to easily visualize spatial autocorrelation, convergence, and spatial effects. Users can 
    create their own spatial weights matrix based on their units and adjacencies of 
    interest, making the use of these models flexible and broadly applicable to a 
    variety of research areas. Joo et al. (2020) <https://github.com/Nicolas-Schmidt/BayesSPsurv/blob/master/man/figures/SPcure.pdf> describe 
    the estimators included in this package.
