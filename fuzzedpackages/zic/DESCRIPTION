Title: Bayesian Inference for Zero-Inflated Count Models
Author: Markus Jochmann <markus.jochmann@ncl.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Markus Jochmann <markus.jochmann@ncl.ac.uk>
Description: Provides MCMC algorithms for the analysis of
        zero-inflated count models. The case of stochastic search
        variable selection (SVS) is also considered.  All MCMC samplers
        are coded in C++ for improved efficiency. A data set
        considering the demand for health care is provided.
