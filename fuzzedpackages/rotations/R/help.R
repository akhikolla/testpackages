#' A package for working with rotation data.
#'
#' This package implements tools for working with rotational data: it allows simulation from the 
#' most commonly used  distributions on \eqn{SO(3)}, it includes methods for different mean and median type 
#' estimators for the central orientation of a sample, it provides confidence regions 
#' for those estimates and it includes a novel visualization technique for rotation data.
