The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features.

Most approaches to topic model learning have been based on a maximum likelihood objective. Efficient algorithms exist that attempt to approximate this objective, but they have no provable guarantees. Recently, algorithms have been introduced that provide provable bounds, but these algorithms are not practical because they are inefficient and not robust to violations of model assumptions. In this paper we present an algorithm for learning topic models that is both provable and practical. The algorithm produces results comparable to the best MCMC implementations while running orders of magnitude faster.}

  abstract = 	 {The Logistic-Normal Topic Admixture Model (LoNTAM), also known as correlated topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2005), is a promising and expressive admixture-based text model. It can capture topic correlations via the use of a logistic-normal distribution to model non-trivial variabilities in the topic mixing vectors underlying documents. However, the non-conjugacy caused by the logistic-normal makes posterior inference and model learning significantly more challenging. In this paper, we present a new, tight approximate inference algorithm for LoNTAM based on a multivariate quadratic Taylor approximation scheme that facilitates elegant closed-form message passing. We present experimental results on simulated data as well as on the NIPS17 and PNAS document collections, and show that our approach is not only simple and easy to implement, but also it converges faster, and leads to more accurate recovery of the semantic truth underlying documents and estimates of the parameters comparing to previous methods.}
