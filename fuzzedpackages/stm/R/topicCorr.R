#' Estimate topic correlation
#' 
#' Estimates a graph of topic correlations using either a simple thresholding
#' measure or more sophisticated tests from the package \code{huge}.
#' 
#' We offer two estimation procedures for producing correlation graphs.  The
#' results of either method can be plotted using \code{\link{plot.topicCorr}}.
#' The first method is conceptually simpler and involves a simple thresholding
#' procedure on the estimated marginal topic proportion correlation matrix and
#' requires a human specified threshold.  The second method draws on recent
#' literature undirected graphical model estimation and is automatically tuned.
#' 
#' The \code{"simple"} method calculates the correlation of the MAP estimates
#' for the topic proportions \eqn{\theta} which yields the marginal correlation
#' of the mode of the variational distribution. Then we simply set to 0 those
#' edges where the correlation falls below the threshold.
#' 
#' An alternative strategy is to treat the problem as the recovery of edges in
#' a high-dimensional undirected graphical model. In these settings we assume
#' that observations come from a multivariate normal distribution with a sparse
#' precision matrix.  The goal is to infer which elements of the precision
#' matrix are non-zero corresponding to edges in a graph.  Meinshausen and
#' Buhlmann (2006) showed that using sparse regression methods like the LASSO
#' it is possible to consistently identify edges even in very high dimensional
#' settings.
#' 
#' Selecting the option \code{"huge"} uses the \code{huge} package by Zhao and
#' Liu to estimate the graph.  We use a nonparanormal transformation of the
#' topic proportions (\eqn{\theta}) which uses semiparametric Gaussian copulas
#' to marginally transform the data.  This weakens the gaussian assumption of
#' the subsequent procedure.  We then estimate the graph using the Meinshausen
#' and Buhlmann procedure.  Model selection for the scale of the \eqn{L_1}
#' penalty is performed using the rotation information criterion (RIC) which
#' estimates the optimal degree of regularization by random rotations.  Zhao
#' and Lieu (2012) note that this selection approach has strong empirical
#' performance but is sensitive to under-selection of edges.  We choose this
#' metric as the default approach to model selection to reflect social
#' scientists' historically greater concern for false positive rates as opposed
#' to false negative rates.
#' 
#' We note that in models with low numbers of topics the simple procedure and
#' the more complex procedure will often yield identical results.  However, the
#' advantage of the more complex procedure is that it scales gracefully to
#' models with hundreds or even thousands of topics - specifically the set of
#' cases where some higher level structure like a correlation graph would be
#' the most useful.
#' 
#' @param model An STM object for which you want to estimate correlations
#' between topics.
#' @param method Method for estimating the graph.  \code{"simple"} simply
#' thresholds the covariances.  \code{"huge"} uses the semiparametric procedure
#' in the package \code{huge}.  See details below.
#' @param cutoff When using the simple method, this is the cutoff below which
#' correlations are truncated to zero.
#' @param verbose A logical which indicates whether information should be
#' printed to the screen when running \code{"huge"}.
#' @return \item{posadj}{K by K adjacency matrix where an edge represents
#' positive correlation selected by the model.} \item{poscor}{K by K
#' correlation matrix.  It takes values of zero where the correlation is either
#' negative or the edge is unselected by the model selection procedure.}
#' \item{cor}{K by K correlation matrix element-wise multiplied by the
#' adjacency matrix. Note that this will contain significant negative
#' correlations as well as positive correlations.}

#' Plot a topic correlation graph
#' 
#' Uses a topic correlation graph estimated by \code{\link{topicCorr}} and the
#' \code{igraph} package to plot a network where nodes are topics and edges
#' indicate a positive correlation.
#' 
#' Essentially a thin wrapper around the plotting functionality in the
#' \code{igraph} package. See package vignette for more details.
#' 
#' @param x A topicCorr model object.
#' @param topics A vector of topics to include in the plot, defaults to all.
#' @param vlabels A character vector of labels for the vertices.  Defaults to
#' "Topic #"
#' @param layout The layout algorithm passed to the \code{igraph} package.  It
#' will choose \code{layout.fruchterman.reingold} by default.  Note that to
#' pass an alternate algorithm you should load the \code{igraph} package first.
#' @param vertex.color Color of the vertices.
#' @param vertex.label.cex Controls the size of the labels.
#' @param vertex.label.color Controls the color of the labels.
#' @param vertex.size Controls the sizes of the vertices, either NULL, a scalar or a vector of the same length as number of topics.
#' @param \dots Additional parameters passed to \code{plot.graph.adjacency}
#' @seealso \code{\link{topicCorr}}
