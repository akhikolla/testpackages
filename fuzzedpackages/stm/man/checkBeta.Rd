\title{Looks for words that load exclusively onto a topic}
\usage{
checkBeta(stmobject, tolerance = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{stmobject}{STM Model Output}

\item{tolerance}{User specified input reflecting closeness to 1.  E.g. a
tolerance of .01 will flag any values greater than .99.  Tolerance must be
above 1e-6.}
}
\value{
\item{problemTopics}{A list of vectors, each vector corresponding to
the set of topics in the relevant beta matrix that contain words with too
high of a loading to that topic } \item{topicErrorTotal}{A list of integers,
each corresponding to the total number of topics with problems in the
relevant beta matrix} \item{problemWords}{A list of matrices, each
corresponding to a relevant beta matrix, which gives the topic and word
index of each word with too high of a topic loading} \item{wordErrorTotal}{A
list of integers, each corresponding to the total words with problems for
the relevant beta matrix} \item{check}{A boolean representing if the check
was passed. If wordErrorTotal is all 0s (no errors), check is True.}
}
\description{
Checks the log beta matrix for values too close to 0, which reflect words
that load onto a single topic.
}
\details{
The function checks the log beta matrix for values that exceed the tolerance
threshold, indicating that a word has loaded onto a single topics. The output
gives the user lists of which topics have problems, which words in which
topics have problems, as well as a count of the total problems in topics and
the total number of problem words.

Note that if the tolerance value is below 1e-6, this function will throw an
error.
