\title{Displays verbose labels that describe topics and topic-covariate groups in
depth.}
\usage{
sageLabels(model, n = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted STM model object.}

\item{n}{The number of words to print per topic/topic-covariate set. Default
is 7.}
}
\value{
\item{marginal}{ A list of matrices, containing the high-probability
labels, FREX labels, lift labels, and high scoring words.  } \item{K}{ The
number of topics in the STM.  } \item{covnames}{ Names of the covariate
values used in the STM.  } \item{kappa}{Words associated with topics,
covariates, and topic/covariate interactions.} \item{kappa.m}{Baseline word
distribution.} \item{n}{ The n parameter passed by the user to this
function; number of words per topic or topic-covariate pair (when covariates
are used on the bottom of the model) } \item{cov.betas}{ Covariate-specific
beta matrices, listing for each covariate a matrix of highest-probability,
FREX, lift, and high scoring words.  Note that the actual vocabulary has
been substituted for word indices.  }
}
\description{
For each topic or, when there is a covariate at the bottom of the model, for
each topic-covariate group, sageLabels provides a list of the highest
marginal probability words, the highest marginal FREX words, the highest
marginal lift words, and the highest marginal score words, where marginal
means it is summing over all potential covariates.  It also provides each
topic's Kappa (words associated with each topic) and baselined Kappa
(baseline word distribution).
