\title{Plotting Method for Multimodality Diagnostic Objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{MultimodDiagnostic}(x, ind = NULL, topics = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of S3 class 'MultimodDiagnostic'. See
\code{\link{multiSTM}}.}

\item{ind}{An integer of list of integers specifying which plots to generate
(see details). If \code{NULL} (default), all plots are generated.}

\item{topics}{An integer or vector of integers specifying the topics for
which to plot the posterior distribution of covariate effect estimates. If
\code{NULL} (default), plots are generated for every topic in the S3 object.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed to the plotting functions.}
}
\description{
The plotting method for objects of the S3 class 'MultimodDiagnostic', which
are returned by the function \code{multiSTM()}, which performs a battery of
tests aimed at assessing the stability of the local modes of an STM model.
}
\details{
This methods generates a series of plots, which are indexed as follows. If a
subset of the plots is required, specify their indexes using the \code{ind}
argument. Please note that not all plot types are available for every object
of class 'MultimodDiagnostic': \enumerate{ \item Histogram of Expected
Common Words: Generates a 10-bin histogram of the column means of
\code{obj$wmat}, a K-by-N matrix reporting the number of "top words" shared
by the reference model and the candidate model. The "top words" for a given
topic are defined as the 10 highest-frequency words.  \item Histogram of
Expected Common Documents: Generates a 10-bin histogram of the column means
of \code{obj$tmat}, a K-by-N matrix reporting the number of "top documents"
shared by the reference model and the candidate model. The "top documents"
for a given topic are defined as the 10 documents in the reference corpus
with highest topical frequency.  \item Distribution of .95
Confidence-Interval Coverage for Regression Estimates: Generates a histogram
of \code{obj$confidence.ratings}, a vector whose entries specify the
proportion of regression coefficient estimates in a candidate model that
fall within the .95 confidence interval for the corresponding estimate in
the reference model. This can only be generated if
\code{obj$confidence.ratings} is non-\code{NULL}.  \item Posterior
Distributions of Covariate Effect Estimates By Topic: Generates a square
matrix of plots, each depicting the posterior distribution of the regression
coefficients for the covariate specified in \code{obj$reg.parameter.index}
for one topic. The topics for which the plots are to be generated are
specified by the \code{topics} argument. If the length of \code{topics} is
not a perfect square, the plots matrix will include white space. The plots
have a dashed black vertical line at zero, and a continuous red vertical
line indicating the coefficient estimate in the reference model. This can
only be generated if \code{obj$cov.effects} is non-\code{NULL}.  \item
Histogram of Expected L1-Distance From Reference Model: Generates a 10-bin
histogram of the column means of \code{obj$lmat}, a K-by-N matrix reporting
the L1-distance of each topic from the corresponding one in the reference
model.  \item L1-distance vs. Top-10 Word Metric: Produces a smoothed color
density representation of the scatterplot of \code{obj$lmat} and
\code{obj$wmat}, the metrics for L1-distance and shared top-words, obtained
through a kernel density estimate. This can be used to validate the metrics
under consideration.  \item L1-distance vs. Top-10 Docs Metric: Produces a
smoothed color density representation of the scatterplot of \code{obj$lmat}
and \code{obj$tmat}, the metrics for L1-distance and shared top-documents,
obtained through a kernel density estimate. This can be used to validate the
metrics under consideration.  \item Top-10 Words vs. Top-10 Docs Metric:
Produces a smoothed color density representation of the scatterplot of
\code{obj$wmat} and \code{obj$tmat}, the metrics for shared top-words and
shared top-documents, obtained through a kernel density estimate. This can
be used to validate the metrics under consideration.  \item Maximized Bound
vs. Aggregate Top-10 Words Metric: Generates a scatter plot with linear
trendline for the maximized bound vector (\code{obj$lb}) and a linear
transformation of the top-words metric aggregated by model
(\code{obj$wmod/1000}).  \item Maximized Bound vs. Aggregate Top-10 Docs
Metric: Generates a scatter plot with linear trendline for the maximized
bound vector (\code{obj$lb}) and a linear transformation of the top-docs
metric aggregated by model (\code{obj$tmod/1000}).  \item Maximized Bound
vs. Aggregate L1-Distance Metric: Generates a scatter plot with linear
trendline for the maximized bound vector (\code{obj$lb}) and a linear
transformation of the L1-distance metric aggregated by model
(\code{obj$tmod/1000}).  \item Top-10 Docs Metric vs. Semantic Coherence:
Generates a scatter plot with linear trendline for the reference-model
semantic coherence scores and the column means of \code{object$tmat}.  \item
L1-Distance Metric vs. Semantic Coherence: Generates a scatter plot with
linear trendline for the reference-model semantic coherence scores and the
column means of \code{object$lmat}.  \item Top-10 Words Metric vs. Semantic
Coherence: Generates a scatter plot with linear trendline for the
reference-model semantic coherence scores and the column means of
\code{object$wmat}.  \item Same as \code{5}, but using the limited-mass
L1-distance metric. Can only be generated if \code{obj$mass.threshold != 1}.
\item Same as \code{11}, but using the limited-mass L1-distance metric. Can
only be generated if \code{obj$mass.threshold != 1}.  \item Same as
\code{7}, but using the limited-mass L1-distance metric. Can only be
generated if \code{obj$mass.threshold != 1}.  \item Same as \code{13}, but
using the limited-mass L1-distance metric. Can only be generated if
\code{obj$mass.threshold != 1}.  }
