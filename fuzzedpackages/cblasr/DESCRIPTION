Description: Provides the 'cblas.h' header file as C interface to the underlying
    internal 'BLAS' library in R. 'CBLAS' <https://www.netlib.org/blas/cblas.h>
    is a collection of wrappers originally written by Keita Teranishi and
    provides a C interface to the FORTRAN 'BLAS' library
    <https://www.netlib.org/blas/>. Note that as internal 'BLAS' library
    provided by R <https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/include/R_ext/BLAS.h>
    is used and only the double precision / double complex 'BLAS' routines are
    supported.
