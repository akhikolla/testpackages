\title{Calculate a set of numerical features from protein sequences}
\usage{
calculate_features(df, min_len = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe which contains protein sequence names as the first column and amino acid sequence as the second column}

\item{min_len}{Minimum length sequence for which features can be calculated. It is an error to provide sequences with length shorter than this}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing numerical values related to the protein features of each given protein
}
\description{
This function calculates set physicochemical and compositional features from protein sequences in preparation for supervised model learning
}
\note{
This function depends on the Peptides package
}
\examples{

my_protein_df <- read_faa(system.file("extdata/bat_protein.fasta", package = "ampir"))

calculate_features(my_protein_df)
