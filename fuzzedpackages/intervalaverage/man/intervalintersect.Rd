\usage{
intervalintersect(
  x,
  y,
  interval_vars,
  group_vars = NULL,
  interval_vars_out = c("start", "end"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.table with two columns defining closed intervals (see also interval_vars parameter)}

\item{y}{A data.table with two columns defining closed intervals (see also interval_vars parameter)}

\item{interval_vars}{Either a length-2 character vector denoting column names in both x and y or a named
length-2 character vector where the names are column names in x and the values are column names in y.
These column names specify columns in x and y that define
closed (inclusive) starting and ending intervals. The column name
specifying the lower-bound column must be specified first.
these columns in x and y must all be of the same class and either be integer or IDate.}

\item{group_vars}{NULL, or either a character vector denoting the column name(s) in x and y,
or a named character vector where the name is the column name in x and the value is the column name in y.
This/these column(s) serve as an additional keying variable in the join (ie in addition to the interval join)
such that intervals in x will only be joined to overlapping in intervals in y where the group_vars values are the same.}

\item{interval_vars_out}{The column names of the interval columns in the return data.table.
By default the return table will contain columns \code{c("start","end")}.
If your input tables already contain these columns,
you need to either specify \code{interval_vars_out} to be non-conflicting names with columns in x and y.
Or you rename columns in x and y to not contain columns named \code{c("start","end")}.}

\item{verbose}{Prints additional information about the function processing.}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns \code{interval_vars_out} which denote the start and
stop period for each interval. This return table also contains columns in x and y. See details
for how naming conflicts are dealt with.
}
\description{
Given two tables each containing a set of intervals, find all interval intersections within groups.
Returns a data.table containing all columns from both tables.
One use of this function is to take a table  containing an address history
(a table containing the intervals when study participants lived at past addresses)
and join it to an exposure history table (a complete set of exposure predictions
for each address, where the exposures are stored as the average value over a
set of intervals) returning the set of
exposure intervals at addresses clipped to exactly when the participant lived at that address.
}
\details{
All intervals are treated as closed (ie inclusive of the start and end values in the columns
specified by interval_vars)

x and y are not copied but rather passed by reference to function internals
but the order of these data.tables is restored on function completion or error,

Technically speaking this is just an inner cartesian join where the last two join variables are
doing a non-equi join for partial overlaps. Then each interval intersect is calculated using max and min.

If there are columns with the same names in both x and y (including interval_vars
but excepting group_vars), the return value will still return both columns. The column in y
will be names as it was originally and the column in x will be prepended with the letter i followed with a dot:
\code{i.} \cr

Note that the function returns the same result if you switch x and y
(with the exception of switched column names in the case of column name conflicts as just discussed)
