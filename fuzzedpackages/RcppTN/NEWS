* Added etn() function for calculation of
  theoretical expectations from Truncated Normal distributions.
* The rtn() function warns on NA return values.
* Checks for valid inputs include a finite mean and finite sd of the
  parent Normal distribution. Warns on invalid.
* Checks for correctly sized inputs. Stops on invalid.
* Added vtn() function for calculation of
  theoretical variances from Truncated Normal distributions.
