Description: R-level and C++-level functionality
    to generate random deviates from and calculate moments of a
    Truncated Normal distribution using the algorithm of Robert (1995) <DOI:10.1007/BF00143942>.
    In addition to RNG, functions for calculating moments, densities,
    and entropies are provided at both levels.
