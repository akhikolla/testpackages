\title{Functions and C++ Header Files for Computation on Manifolds}
\description{
We provide a number of algorithms to estimate fundamental statistics including 
Fr√©chet mean and geometric median for manifold-valued data. Also, C++ header files are contained that implement elementary operations 
on manifolds such as Sphere, Grassmann, and others. See Bhattacharya and Bhattacharya (2012) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781139094764> 
if you are interested in statistics on manifolds, and Absil et al (2007) <isbn:978-0-691-13298-3> on computational 
aspects of optimization on matrix manifolds.
