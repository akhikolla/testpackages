# bigsnpr

{bigsnpr} is an R package for the analysis of massive SNP arrays, primarily designed for human genetics. It enhances the features of [package {bigstatsr}](https://privefl.github.io/bigstatsr/) for the purpose of analyzing genotype data.

[Quick demo](https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/demo.html)

[**LIST OF FEATURES**](https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/reference/index.html)

**Note that most of the algorithms of this package don't handle missing values.** You can use `snp_fastImpute()` (taking a few hours for a chip of 15K x 300K) and `snp_fastImputeSimple()` (taking a few minutes only) to impute missing values of *genotyped* variants.

**New!** Package {bigsnpr} now provides functions that directly work on bed files with a few missing values. See new paper "Efficient toolkit implementing..".


## Installation

In R, run

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("privefl/bigsnpr")
```

or for the CRAN version

```r
install.packages("bigsnpr")
```


## Input formats

This package reads *bed*/*bim*/*fam* files (PLINK preferred format) using functions `snp_readBed()` and `snp_readBed2()`. Before reading into this package's special format, quality control and conversion can be done using PLINK, which can be called directly from R using `snp_plinkQC()` and `snp_plinkKINGQC()`.

This package can also read **UK Biobank BGEN files** using function `snp_readBGEN()`. This function takes around 40 minutes to read 1M variants for 400K individuals using 15 cores.

This package uses a class called `bigSNP` for representing SNP data. A `bigSNP` object is a list with some elements:

- `genotypes`: A [`FBM.code256`](https://privefl.github.io/bigstatsr/reference/FBM.code256-class.html). Rows are samples and columns are SNPs. This stores genotype calls or **dosages** (rounded to 2 decimal places).
- `fam`: A `data.frame` with some information on the SNPs.
- `map`: A `data.frame` with some information on the individuals.

**New!** Package {bigsnpr} now provides functions that directly work on bed files with a few missing values. See new paper "Efficient toolkit implementing..".


## Polygenic scores

Polygenic scores are one of the main focus of this package. There are 3 main methods currently available:

- Penalized regressions with individual-level data (see [paper](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.119.302019) and [tutorial](https://privefl.github.io/bigstatsr/articles/penalized-regressions.html))

- Clumping and Thresholding (C+T) and Stacked C+T (SCT) with summary statistics and individual level data (see [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.11.001) and [tutorial](https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/SCT.html)).

- LDpred2 with summary statistics (see [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.066720) and [tutorial](https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/LDpred2.html))


## Possible upcoming features

- Multiple imputation for GWAS (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006091).

- More interactive (visual) QC.
