#' @name ipass
#' @docType data
#' @keywords datasets
#' @description Reconstructed IPASS clinical trial data reported in Argyropoulos and Unruh (2015). Although reconstructed, this data set preserves all features exhibited in references with full access to the observations from this clinical trial. The data base is related to the period of March 2006 to April 2008. The main purpose of the study is to compare the drug gefitinib against carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy as first line treatment, in terms of progression free survival (in months), to be applied to selected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

#'   \item status: failure indicator (1 - failure; 0 - otherwise)
#'   \item arm: (1 - gefitinib; 0 - carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy)

#' @description Data set from a clinical trial conducted by the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GTSG) in 1982. The data set refers to the survival times of patients with locally nonresectable gastric cancer. Patients were either treated with chemotherapy combined with radiation or chemotherapy alone.
