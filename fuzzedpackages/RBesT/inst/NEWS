* add demo for 2S OC simulation code for time-to-event endpoint with
  constant hazard assumption
* drop tidyverse dependency
* expand SBC checks to include group specifc estimates

  bayesplot_theme_* functions. See ?bayesplot::bayesplot_theme_get.
* correct transformation issue in MAP for variances vignette - thanks
  to Ping Chen
* allow for constrained fitting of beta mixtures which have a & b
  parameters greater than 1. This is the new default behavior which
  the function will inform about. The informational message will be
  removed in a future release.

  all.equal internally accounting for machine specifc tolerances) to
  pass tests for no long double case. Numerical tolerances are
  reverted back to 1.3-1 settings.

January 25th, 2018 (1.3-2)
