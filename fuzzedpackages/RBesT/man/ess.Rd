of the expected information for the Poisson-Gamma case of
Morita method (defaults to 1E-4).}

\description{
Calculates the Effective Sample Size (ESS) for a mixture prior. The
ESS indicates how many experimental units the prior is roughly
equivalent to.
}
\details{
The ESS is calculated using either the expected local
    information ratio (elir) \emph{Neuenschwander et
    al. (submitted)}, the moments approach or the method by
    \emph{Morita et al. (2008)}.

The elir approach is the only ESS which fulfills predictive
consistency. The predictive consistency of the ESS requires that
the ESS of a prior is the same as averaging the posterior ESS after
a fixed amount of events over the prior predictive distribution
from which the number of forward simulated events is
subtracted. The elir approach results in ESS estimates which are
neither conservative nor liberal whereas the moments method yields
conservative and the morita method liberal results. See the example
section for a demonstration of predictive consistency.

For the moments method the mean and standard deviation of the
mixture are calculated and then approximated by the conjugate
distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. For
conjugate distributions, the ESS is well defined. See the examples
for a step-wise calculation in the beta mixture case.

The Morita method used here evaluates the mixture prior at the mode
instead of the mean as proposed originally by Morita. The method
may lead to very optimistic ESS values, especially if the mixture
contains many components. The calculation of the Morita approach
here follows the approach presented in Neuenschwander B. et all
(2019) which avoids the need for a minimization and does not
restrict the ESS to be an integer.
