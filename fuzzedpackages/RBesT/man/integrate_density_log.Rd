\title{internal function used for integration of densities which appears
to be much more stable from -Inf to +Inf in the logit space while
the density to be integrated recieves inputs from 0 to 1 such that
the inverse distribution function must be used. The integral solved
is int_x dmix(mix,x) integrand(x) where integrand must be given as
log and we integrate over the support of mix.}
\usage{
integrate_density_log(log_integrand, mix, Lplower = -Inf,
  Lpupper = Inf, eps = 1e-09)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_integrand}{function to integrate over which must return the log(f)}

\item{mix}{density over which to integrate}

\item{Lplower}{logit of lower cumulative density}

\item{Lpupper}{logit of upper cumulative density}
}
\description{
integrate density in logit space and split by component such
that the quantile function of each component is used. This
ensures that the R implementation of the quantile function is
always used.
