Prevously, it was possible it import genetic data via the Package `PopGenome`.
Unfortunately, `PopGenome` was removed from CRAN in early 2020, so this is not 
an option anymore. 

You will have to import your data and convert it into a 
`seg_sites` object manually. Please refer to the `create_segsites` section
in `coala`'s documentation for details.
