#' adpss: A package for design and analysis of a locally or globally efficient adaptive design involving adaptive sample size determination.
#' 
#' This package provides the functions for conducting a trial with adaptive
#' sample size determination.
#' Such a trial consists of adaptive determination of sample size
#' at an interim analysis and implementation of frequentist statistical test of
#' a prefixed significance level.
#' The required assumptions for the stochastic process of the test statistics is Brownian motion.
#' Predetermination of adaptation rule is not required, i.e., adaptations can be made with full flexibility.
