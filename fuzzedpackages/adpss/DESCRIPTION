Description: Provides the functions for planning and conducting a
  clinical trial with adaptive sample size determination. Maximal statistical
  efficiency will be exploited even when dramatic or multiple adaptations
  are made. Such a trial consists of adaptive determination of sample size
  at an interim analysis and implementation of frequentist statistical test at the
  interim and final analysis with a prefixed significance level. The required
  assumptions for the stage-wise test statistics are independent and stationary
  increments and normality. Predetermination of adaptation rule is not required.
