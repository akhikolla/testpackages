aic.R:  These functions are used to compute Information Criteria such as AIC, BIC or EBIC from a fitted model object.

bess.one.R:  Best subset selection with a specified model size for generalized linear models and Cox's proportional hazard model.

bess.R:  Best subset selection for generalized linear model and Cox's proportional model. This function is used to determine the subset size k.

coef.bess.R:  This function provides estimated coefficients from a fitted "bess" object or a fitted "bess.one" object.

deviance.bess.R:  This function provides deviance from a fitted "bess" object or a fitted "bess.one" object.

LogLik.bess.R:  This function provides loglikelihood from a fitted "bess" object or a fitted "bess.one" object.

plot.bess.R:  Produces a coefficient profile plot of the coefficient or loss paths for a fitted "bess" object.

predict.bess.R:  This function provides predictions from a fitted "bess" object or a fitted "bess.one" object.

print.bess.R:  Print a summary of the "bess" path at each step along the path.
