Description: An ADMM implementation of SDP-1, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the maximum likelihood estimator for fitting a block model. SDP-1 has a tendency to produce equal-sized blocks and is ideal for producing a form of network histogram approximating a nonparametric graphon model. Alternatively, it can be used for community detection. (This is experimental code, proceed with caution.)
