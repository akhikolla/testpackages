Description: Combine multiple-relationship networks into a single weighted
    network.  The approach is similar to factor analysis in the that
    contribution from each constituent network varies so as to maximize the
    information gleaned from the multiple-relationship networks.
    This implementation uses Principal Component Analysis calculated using
    'prcomp' with bootstrap subsampling.  Missing links are imputed using
    the method of Chen et al.
    (2012).
