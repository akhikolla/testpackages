\title{
Bayesian community ecology analysis
}
\description{
BayesComm fits Bayesian multivariate binary (probit) regression models for analysis of ecological communities.
These models can be used to make inference about underlying inter-species interactions in communities and to separate the effects of environmental covariates and inter-species interactions on community assembly.
This package accompanies the paper (in preparation) by Golding et al. (2013) and is based on a model described by Edwards and Allenby (2003).

BayesComm models take as input a matrix of species presence/absence records and optionally a matrix of environmental covariates.
\code{\link{BC}} is the main function for setting up models.
It is a wrapper function to \code{\link{BCfit}} and returns a \code{bayescomm} object.
\code{bayescomm} objects have associated \code{summary}, \code{plot}, \code{print}, \code{window} and \code{residuals} functions.
Functions are also provided to calculate Deviance Information Criteria (\code{\link{DIC}}) and run a deviance partitioning procedure on model outputs (\code{\link{devpart}}).

Full details of formulation of the model are given in Golding et al. (2013).
