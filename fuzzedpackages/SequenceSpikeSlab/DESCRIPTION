Description: Contains fast functions to calculate the exact Bayes posterior
  for the Sparse Normal Sequence Model, which implement the algorithms described in
  Van Erven and Szabo (2018) <arXiv:1810.10883>. For general hierarchical priors,
  sample sizes up to 10,000 are feasible within half an hour on a standard laptop.
  For beta-binomial spike-and-slab priors, a faster algorithm is provided, which
  can handle sample sizes of 100,000 in half an hour. In the implementation,
  special care has been taken to assure numerical stability of the methods even for
  such large sample sizes.
