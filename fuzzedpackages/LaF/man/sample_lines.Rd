\title{Read in random lines from a text file}
\usage{
sample_lines(filename, n, nlines = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{character containing the filename of the file from which the
lines should be read.}

\item{n}{The number of lines that should be sampled from the file.}

\item{nlines}{The total number of lines in the file. If not specified or
\code{NULL} the number of lines is first determined using
\code{\link{determine_nlines}}.}
}
\value{
Returns a character vector with the sampled lines.
}
\description{
Read in random lines from a text file
}
\details{
When \code{nlines} is not specified, the total number of lines is first
determined. This can take quite some time. Therefore, specifying the number of
lines can cause a significant speed up. It can also be used to sample lines
from the first \code{nlines} line by specifying a value for \code{nlines} that
is smaller than the number of lines in the file.
}
\examples{
# Create temporary filename
tmpcsv  <- tempfile(fileext="csv")

writeLines(letters[1:20], con=tmpcsv)
sample_lines(tmpcsv, 10)

# Cleanup
file.remove(tmpcsv)

}
\seealso{
See \code{\link{readLines}} to read in all lines a text file;
\code{\link{get_lines}} can be used to read in specified lines.
