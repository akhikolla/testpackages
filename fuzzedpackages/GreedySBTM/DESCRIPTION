Description: Performs clustering on the nodes of an undirected binary dynamic network, by maximising the exact integrated complete likelihood. The greedy algorithm used is described in Rastelli, R. (2017) "Exact integrated completed likelihood maximisation in a stochastic block transition model for dynamic networks" <arXiv:1710.03551>.
