}

\details{
The variables in Dexter consist of the item properties and person properties you specified
and a number of reserved variables that are automatically defined like \code{response} and \code{booklet_id}.

Variables in Dexter are most useful when used in predicate expressions. A number of functions can 
take a dataSrc argument and an optional predicate. Predicates are 
a concise and flexible way to filter data for the different psychometric functions in Dexter.

The variables can also be used to retrieve data in \code{\link{get_responses}}
