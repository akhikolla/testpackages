\arguments{
\item{dbname}{filename/path of new dexter project database (will be overwritten if already exists)}

\item{scr_path}{path to the .scr file}

\item{dat_path}{path to the .dat file}

\item{booklet_position}{vector of start and end of booklet position in the dat file, e.g. c(1,4), 
all positions are counted from 1, start and end are both inclusive. If NULL, this is read from the scr file.}

\item{responses_start}{start position of responses in the .dat file. If NULL, this is read from the scr file.}

\item{response_length}{length of individual responses, default=1}

\item{person_id}{optionally, a vector of start and end position of person_id in the .dat file.
If NULL, person id's will be auto-generated.}

\item{missing_character}{vector of character(s) used to indicate missing in .dat file, 
default is to use both a space and a 9 as missing characters.}

\item{use_discrim}{if TRUE, the scores for the responses will be multiplied by the
discrimination parameters of the items}

\item{format}{not used, at the moment only the compressed format is supported.}
}
\value{
a database connection object.

\description{
Creates a dexter project database and fills it with response data based on a .dat and .scr file
}
\details{
start_new_project_from_oplm builds a complete dexter database from a .dat and .scr file in
the proprietary oplm format. Three custom variables are added to the database: 
booklet_on_off, item_local_on_off, item_global_on_off. These are taken from the .scr file
and can be used in predicates in the various dexter functions.

Booklet_position and responses_start are usually inferred from the scr file but since they
are sometimes misspecified in the scr file they can be overridden. Response_length is not 
inferred from the scr file since anything other than 1 is most often a mistake.
