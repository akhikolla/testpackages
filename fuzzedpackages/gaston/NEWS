1.1: corrected C++ code (compilation errors on some distributions)
1.2: kinhsip matrix is now in single precision (faster) 
     various minor changes
1.3: corrected bug in HWE chi square (monomorphic SNP) 
     select.snps and select.inds (negative indices, presence of NAs)
1.3.1: suppressed various __attribute__ ((aligned(16))) in m4_kinship*.cpp
       which seemed to be causing an (intermittent) bug (?!)
1.4: introduced option gastion.auto.set.stats / updated vignette accordingly
     +hz in ped stats
     new function reshape.GRM
     as.bed.matrix no longer is a method, but a function
     minor modifs in read.vcf
     matrix4 now uses uint8_t array instead of char array (induced many 
     small changes in the C++ code).
1.4.5: corrected a bug in method 'show'
       better handling of constraints in AIREML methods 
       faster implementation of GRM
       new function genomic.sex
1.4.6: Modified Imports/Depends fields to remove a warning about RcppParallel
       Modified VCF handling functions to follow the new interface of WhopGenome 
          (patch by Tomas Kalibera and Ulrich Wittelsbuerger)
       New functions logistic.mm.aireml, score.variance.linear, score.variance.logistic, score.fixed.linear, score.fixed.logistic
       New argument get.P in lmm.aireml
       New features and arguments in association.test
       Minor modifications of the vignette (illustration of association.test)
1.4.7: Corrected (minor) bug in association.test (handling of monomorphic SNPs in some tests)
       New function LD.plot / LDheatmap dependence removed
       Handling NAs in select.snp select.inds
       Added chr X, Y, MT support / modified set.stats, set.genomic.sex accordingly
       Added which.snps argument in LD.thin and GRM
       rbind and cbind now check individuals ids / snp ids ; rbind check reference alleles
          and perform reference inversions / strand flips if needed.
       Integrated code from CompQuadForm / removed dependence 
          (CompQuadForm does not compile with R < 3.3 which bothers us)
       Minor modifications of the vignette (update description of modified functions)
1.4.8: Corrected bug in set.stats (stats for chr Y)
       Finally removed CompQuadForm from dependence list !
       Minor modifs in read vcf, rbind, set.genomic.sex
       New function merge.inds (finalement, pas exportÃ©e)
       New functions (short cuts) is.autosome, is.chr.x, is.chr.y, is.chr.mt
1.4.9: Modification of rbind, cbind to handle bed.matrices with different column names in @ped, @snps
       A new test in association.test
       Minor changes in GRM and LD.thin 
1.5:   VCF files support
       Computation of the Dominance Matrix (DM)
       New functions test.snps test.inds which.snps which.inds
       Faster optimization with the diagonalization trick
       Auto set the #threads when loaded
1.5.1: Improved functions association.test / random.pm
       Vignette in knitr
       cbind : now keep p, mu, sigma
       rbind : now handles alleles longer than 1
       New functions qqplot.pvalue, manhattan
       New functions SNP.duplicated, SNP.match
       New functions lmm.restricted.likelihood, lmm.profile.restricted.likelihood
1.5.2  Remove some compilation warnings (-Wreorder)
       Temporarily disable TBB (UBSAN test) + function setThreadOptions
1.5.3  Cast in log() function (fix compilation error on solaris)
       Modified plot thinning in qqplot.pvalues
1.5.4  New functions SNP.rm.duplicates and set.dist
       Argument 'by = ' in SNP.match
       Re-enabled TBB
       Improved logistic regression code / small improvements in association.test
1.5.5  Corrected naugthy bug in logistic regression (in case of 20 iterations, still compute covariance matrix!!!)
       (bug introduced in 1.5.4)
       Started to build an FAQ
1.5.6  Corrected bug in gwas lmm wald (PQL) (was sending back NaNs only :/ )
1.5.7  Corrected return; to return() as requested by the CRAN
       Improved code for snp_hash.h (from gaston.utils)
       Argument EM in logistic-mm-aireml
