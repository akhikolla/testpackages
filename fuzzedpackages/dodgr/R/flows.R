#' dodgr_flows_aggregate
#'
#' Aggregate flows throughout a network based on an input matrix of flows
#' between all pairs of `from` and `to` points.
#'
#' @param graph `data.frame` or equivalent object representing the network
#' graph (see Details)
#' @param from Vector or matrix of points **from** which aggregate flows are to
#' be calculated (see Details)
#' @param to Vector or matrix of points **to** which aggregate flows are to be
#' calculated (see Details)
#' @param flows Matrix of flows with `nrow(flows)==length(from)` and
#' `ncol(flows)==length(to)`.
#' @param contract If `TRUE`, calculate flows on contracted graph before
#' mapping them back on to the original full graph (recommended as this will
#' generally be much faster).
#' @param heap Type of heap to use in priority queue. Options include
#' Fibonacci Heap (default; `FHeap`), Binary Heap (`BHeap`),
#' Trinomial Heap (`TriHeap`), Extended Trinomial Heap
#' (`TriHeapExt`, and 2-3 Heap (`Heap23`).
#' @param tol Relative tolerance below which flows towards `to` vertices are not
#' considered. This will generally have no effect, but can provide speed gains
#' when flow matrices represent spatial interaction models, in which case this
#' parameter effectively reduces the radius from each `from` point over which
#' flows are aggregated. To remove any such effect, set `tol = 0`.
#' @param quiet If `FALSE`, display progress messages on screen.
#' @inheritParams dodgr_flows_si
#' @return Modified version of graph with additonal `flow` column added.
#'
#' @note Spatial Interaction models are often fitted through trialling a range
#' of values of 'k'. The specification above allows fitting multiple values of
#' 'k' to be done with a single call, in a way that is far more efficient than
#' making multiple calls. A matrix of 'k' values may be entered, with each
#' column holding a different vector of values, one for each 'from' point. For a
#' matrix of 'k' values having 'n' columns, the return object will be a modified
#' version in the input 'graph', with an additional 'n' columns, named 'flow1',
#' 'flow2', ... up to 'n'. These columns must be subsequently matched by the
#' user back on to the corresponding columns of the matrix of 'k' values.
#'
#' @note The `norm_sums` parameter should be used whenever densities at origins
#' and destinations are absolute values, and ensures that the sum of resultant
#' flow values throughout the entire network equals the sum of densities at all
#' origins. For example, with `norm_sums = TRUE` (the default), a flow from a
#' single origin with density one to a single destination along two edges will
#' allocate flows of one half to each of those edges, such that the sum of flows
#' across the network will equal one, or the sum of densities from all origins.
#' The `norm_sums = TRUE` option is appropriate where densities are relative
#' values, and ensures that each edge maintains relative proportions. In the
#' above example, flows along each of two edges would equal one, for a network
#' sum of two, or greater than the sum of densities.
#'
#' With `norm_sums = TRUE`, the sum of network flows (`sum(output$flow)`) should
#' equal the sum of origin densities (`sum(dens_from)`). This may nevertheless
#' not always be the case, because origin points may simply be too far from any
#' denstination (`to`) points for an exponential model to yield non-zero values
#' anywhere in a network within machine tolerance. Such cases may result in sums
#' of output flows being less than sums of input densities.
#'
#' Flows are calculated by default using parallel computation with the maximal
#' number of available cores or threads. This number can be reduced by
#' specifying a value via
#' `RcppParallel::setThreadOptions (numThreads = <desired_number>)`.
