#' dodgr_contract_graph
#'
#' Removes redundant (straight-line) vertices from graph, leaving only junction
#' vertices.
#'
#' @param graph A flat table of graph edges. Must contain columns labelled
#' `from` and `to`, or `start` and `stop`. May also contain
#' similarly labelled columns of spatial coordinates (for example
#' `from_x`) or `stop_lon`).
#' @param verts Optional list of vertices to be retained as routing points.
#' These must match the `from` and `to` columns of `graph`.
#'
#' @return A contracted version of the original `graph`, containing the same
#' number of columns, but with each row representing an edge between two
#' junction vertices (or between the submitted `verts`, which may or may not be
#' junctions).
