\usage{
dodgr_distances(
  graph,
  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  shortest = TRUE,
  pairwise = FALSE,
  heap = "BHeap",
  parallel = TRUE,
  quiet = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{\code{data.frame} or equivalent object representing the network
graph (see Notes)}

\item{from}{Vector or matrix of points \strong{from} which route distances are to
be calculated (see Notes)}

\item{to}{Vector or matrix of points \strong{to} which route distances are to be
calculated (see Notes)}

\item{shortest}{If \code{FALSE}, calculate distances along the \emph{fastest}
rather than shortest routes (see Notes).}

\item{pairwise}{If \code{TRUE}, calculate distances only between the ordered
pairs of \code{from} and \code{to}.}

\item{heap}{Type of heap to use in priority queue. Options include
Fibonacci Heap (default; \code{FHeap}), Binary Heap (\code{BHeap}),
\verb{Trinomial Heap (}TriHeap\verb{), Extended Trinomial Heap (}TriHeapExt\verb{, and 2-3 Heap (}Heap23`).}

\item{parallel}{If \code{TRUE}, perform routing calculation in parallel (see
details)}

\item{quiet}{If \code{FALSE}, display progress messages on screen.}
}
\value{
square matrix of distances between nodes

# A simple graph

                     to = c ("B", "A", "C", "D", "B", "D", "C", "A"),

# A larger example from the included [hampi()] data.
graph <- weight_streetnet (hampi)
from <- sample (graph$from_id, size = 100)
to <- sample (graph$to_id, size = 50)
d <- dodgr_dists (graph, from = from, to = to)
# d is a 100-by-50 matrix of distances between `from` and `to`
