/* --- FHeapNode ---
 * Fibonacci heap node class.
 *
 * A nodes has the following pointers:
 * parent      - a pointer to the nodes parent node (if any).
 * child       - a pointer to a child node (typically the highest rank child).
 * left, right - sibling pointers which provide a circular doubly linked list
 *               containing all the parents nodes children.
 *
 * The remaining fields are:
 * rank        - the nodes rank, that is, the number of children it has.
 * key         - the nodes key.
 * item        - the number of the item that the node is associated with.

 * trees - An array of pointers to trees at root level in the heap.  Entry i
 *         in the array points to the root node of a tree that has nodes of
 *         dimension i on the main trunk.
 * nodes - An array of pointers to nodes in the heap.  Nodes are indexed
 *         according to their vertex number.  This array can then be used to
 *         look up the node for corresponding to a vertex number, and is
 *         useful when freeing space taken up by the heap.
 * maxNodes - The maximum number of nodes allowed in the heap.
 * maxTrees - The maximum number of trees allowed in the heap (calculated from
 *             maxNodes).
 * itemCount - The current number of nodes in the heap.
 * treeSum - The binary value represented by trees in the heap.
 *           By maintaining this it is easy to keep track of the maximum rank
 *           tree in the heap.
 * compCount - can be used for experimental purposes when counting the number
 *             of key comparisons.
