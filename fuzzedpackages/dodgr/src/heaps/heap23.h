/* This 2-3 heap implementation uses the same kind of pointer structure for
 * nodes as the Fibonacci heap does.
 *
 * This 2-3 heap implementation was designed for use with Dijkstra's single
 * source shortest path algorithm.  Nodes have a vertex number and a key.
 * This source code could easily be modified to use a pointer (void *) to any
 * structure, rather than using vertex numbers as an index.

/* --- Heap23Node ---
 * Class for node objects in the 2-3 heap.
 *
 * The pointer 'parent' points to a nodes parent, and 'child' points to the
 * highest dimension child in a circular doubly linked list of child nodes.
 * The circular doubly linked list of child nodes is maintained using the
 * sibling pointers 'left' and 'right'.  The parent pointer of root nodes is
 * NULL.
 *
 * The remaining structure fields are:
 *  dim       - the nodes dimension.
 *  key       - the nodes key.
 *  item      - the number of the item that the node is associated with.
 *
 * In this implementation, dimensioning of nodes begins at zero, so the
 * dimension of a single node with no children is zero.

/* The structure type for a 2-3 heap.
 *
 * trees - An array of pointers to trees at root level in the heap.  Entry i
 *         in the array points to the root node of a tree that has nodes of
 *         dimension i on the main trunk.
 * nodes - An array of pointers to nodes in the heap.  Nodes are indexed
 *         according to their vertex number.  This array can then be used to
 *         look up the node for corresponding to a vertex number, and is
 *         useful when freeing space taken up by the heap.
 * maxNodes - The maximum number of nodes allowed in the heap.
 * maxTrees - The maximum number of trees allowed in the heap (calculated from
 *             maxNodes).
 * itemCount - The current number of nodes in the heap.
 * treeSum - The binary value represented by trees in the heap.
 *           By maintaining this it is easy to keep track of the maximum rank
 *           tree in the heap.
 * compCount - can be used for experimental purposes when counting the number
 *             of key comparisons.
