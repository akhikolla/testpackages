Description: Distances on dual-weighted directed graphs using priority-queue
    shortest paths (Padgham (2019) <doi:10.32866/6945>). Weighted directed
    graphs have weights from A to B which may differ from those from B to A.
    Dual-weighted directed graphs have two sets of such weights. A canonical
    example is a street network to be used for routing in which routes are
    calculated by weighting distances according to the type of way and mode of
    transport, yet lengths of routes must be calculated from direct distances.
