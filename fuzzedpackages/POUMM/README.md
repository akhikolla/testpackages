# The Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed Model

The Phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mixed Model (POUMM) allows to
estimate the phylogenetic heritability of a continuous trait, to test
hypotheses of neutral evolution versus stabilizing selection, to
quantify the strength of stabilizing selection, to estimate measurement
error and to make predictions about the evolution of a phenotype and
phenotypic variation in a population. The POUMM package provides an easy
and efficient way to perform this variety of analyses on large
macro-evolutionary or epidemic trees. It implements a fast-likelihood
calculation algorithm enabling MCMC-sampling with millions of iterations
within minutes on contemporary multiple core processors. The package
provides functions for configuring the fit of the model and a number of
standard generic functions such as logLik, plot, summary, allowing a
visual and a statistical assessment of the goodness of fit. This is an
important step before using the model fit to answer relevant biological
questions.

# Using the R-package

Here is a quick example on how to use the package on a simulated tree
and trait data:

``` r
# number of tips
N <- 500 

# phylogeny
tr <- ape::rtree(N)

# for the example, simulate trait values on the tree according to a POUMM model.
z <- rVNodesGivenTreePOUMM(
  tree = tr,   
  z0 = 0,      # fixed value at the root
  alpha = 2,   # selection strength of the OU process
  theta = 3,   # long term mean of the OU process
  sigma = 1,   # unit-time standard deviation of the OU process
  sigmae = 1   # standard deviation of the non-heritable component
)[1:N]         # only the values at the N tips will be available in reality

# A combined ML and MCMC fit of the model with default parameter settings.
fit <- POUMM(z, tr)

plot(fit)
summary(fit)
AIC(fit)
BIC(fit)
coef(fit)
logLik(fit)
fitted(fit)
plot(resid(fit))
abline(h=0)

# fit PMM to the same data and do a likelihood ratio test
fitPMM <- POUMM(z, tr)
lmtest::lrtest(fitPMM, fit)
```

For an introduction to the model parameters and the package, read the
[User guide](https://venelin.github.io/POUMM/articles/UserGuide.html).
More advanced topics, such as parametrizations and interpretations of
the model fit are covered in the other package
[vignettes](https://venelin.github.io/POUMM/articles/index.html) and in
the package help-pages, e.g.Â `?POUMM`, `?specifyPOUMM`,
`?summary.POUMM`, `?plot.POUMM`.
