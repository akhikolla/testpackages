@article{Brunet:2004,
	Abstract = {We describe here the use of nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}), an algorithm based on decomposition by parts that can reduce the dimension of expression data from thousands of genes to a handful of metagenes. Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, {NMF} is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of {NMF} to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. {NMF} appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},
