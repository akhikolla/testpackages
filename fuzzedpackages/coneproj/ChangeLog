* update 'a' again according to 'h' if nrep == the upper limit of iterations to the avoid size mismatch problem
* sm reset to be 1e-5
* add a line to set check = 1 in coneB if any edge in delta is chosen; otherwise set check = 0

* change 'equal' to be in check_irred
* set addrownums = FALSE in order to avoid row name errors in check_irred
* scale b2 by length in while loop of coneB
