Description: Fast, optimal, and reproducible weighted univariate
 clustering by dynamic programming. Four problem are solved, including
 univariate k-means (Wang & Song 2011) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2011-015>
 (Song & Zhong 2020) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa613>, k-median,
 k-segments, and multi-channel weighted k-means. Dynamic programming
 is used to minimize the sum of (weighted) within-cluster distances
 using respective metrics. Its advantage over heuristic clustering in
 efficiency and accuracy is pronounced at a large number of clusters.
 Weighted k-means can also process time series to perform peak
 calling. Multi-channel weighted k-means groups multiple univariate
 signals into k clusters. An auxiliary function generates histograms
 adaptive to patterns in data. This package provides a powerful set
 of tools for univariate data analysis with guaranteed optimality,
 efficiency, and reproducibility.
