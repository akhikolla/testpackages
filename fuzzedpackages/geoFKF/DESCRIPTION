Description: A Kriging method for  functional datasets with spatial dependency.
    This functional Kriging method avoids the need to estimate the
    trace-variogram, and the curve is estimated by minimizing a quadratic
    form. The curves in the functional dataset are smoothed using Fourier
    series. The functional Kriging of this package is a modification of the
    method proposed by Giraldo (2011) <doi:10.1007/s10651-010-0143-y>.
