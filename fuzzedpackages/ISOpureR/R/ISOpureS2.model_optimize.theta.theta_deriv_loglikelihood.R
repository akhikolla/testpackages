### FUNCTION: ISOpureS2.model_optimize.theta.theta_deriv_loglikelihood.R #########################################################
#
# Input variables:
#   ww: the theta weights correspoding to patient dd, a 1xK matrix
#   tumourdata: a GxD matrix representing gene expression profiles of tumour samples
#   dd: the patient number
#   model: list containing all the parameters to be optimized
# 
# Output variables:
#   deriv_loglikelihood: derivative of the loglikelihood function relevant to optimizing theta, not 
#      with respect to theta but with respect to unconstrained variables
