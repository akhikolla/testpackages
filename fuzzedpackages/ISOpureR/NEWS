==========================

Minor update
-------------
- removed RcppEigen from the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION file, and added to LinkedTo
  field only
- changed the data in inst/extdata/Beer to use a part of Beer data with 1000 transcripts, 
  30 patients in order to further decrease the memory use


ISOpureR 1.0.7 2014-12-18
==========================

Minor update
-------------
- edited the .cpp file to use RcppEigen::Map which means the matrix is not copied, but
  accessed from the same memory location


ISOpureR 1.0.6 2014-12-16

Major update
-------------
- used RcppEigen to create a C++ function wrapped into R that finds the maximum over columns,
