Description: In statistical modeling, there is a wide variety of regression models for categorical dependent variables (nominal or ordinal data); yet, there is no software embracing all these models together in a uniform and generalized format. Following the methodology proposed by Peyhardi, Trottier, and Gu√©don (2015) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asv042>, we introduce 'GLMcat', an R package to estimate generalized linear models implemented under the unified specification (r, F, Z). Where r represents the ratio of probabilities (reference, cumulative, adjacent, or sequential), F the cumulative distribution function for the linkage, and Z, the design matrix.
