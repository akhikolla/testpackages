\title{Stem segmentation algorithm: Iterated Reweighted Least Squares circle fit}
\usage{
sgt.irls.circle(tol = 0.1, n = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{tol}{\code{numeric} - tolerance offset between absolute radii estimates and hough transform estimates.}

\item{n}{\code{numeric} - maximum number of points to sample for fitting stem segments.}
}
\description{
This function is meant to be used inside \code{\link{stemSegmentation}}. It applies a reweighted least squares circle fit algorithm using M-estimators in order to remove outlier effects.

\section{Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) Algorithm}{


\emph{irls} \code{circle} or \code{cylinder} estimation methods 
perform automatic outlier assigning through iterative reweighting
with M-estimators, followed by a Nelder-Mead optimization of squared distance sums
to determine the best circle/cylinder parameters for a given point
cloud. The reweighting strategy used in \emph{TreeLS} is based on 
Liang et al. (2012). The Nelder-Mead algorithm implemented in Rcpp was provided by 
\href{https://github.com/kthohr/optim}{kthohr/optim}.
}

\section{Least Squares Circle Fit}{


The circle fit methods applied in \emph{TreeLS} estimate the circle parameters (its center's XY coordinates and radius)
from a pre-selected (denoised) set of points in a least squares fashion
by applying either \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition}{QR decompostion}, used in combination
with the RANSAC algorithm, or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder-Mead_method}{Nelder-Mead simplex}
optimization combined the IRLS approach.

The parameters returned by the circle fit methods are:
\itemize{
   \item \code{X,Y}: 2D circle center coordinates
   \item \code{Radius}: 2D circle radius, in point cloud units
   \item \code{Error}: model circle error from the least squares fit
   \item \code{AvgHeight}: average height of the stem segment's points
   \item \code{N}: number of points belonging to the stem segment
 }
