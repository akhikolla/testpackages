\usage{
sgt.irls.cylinder(tol = 0.1, n = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{tol}{\code{numeric} - tolerance offset between absolute radii estimates and hough transform estimates.}

\item{n}{\code{numeric} - maximum number of points to sample for fitting stem segments.}
}
\description{
This function is meant to be used inside \code{\link{stemSegmentation}}. It applies a reweighted least squares cylinder fit algorithm using M-estimators and Nelder-Mead optimization in order to remove outlier effects.

\section{Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) Algorithm}{


\emph{irls} \code{circle} or \code{cylinder} estimation methods 
perform automatic outlier assigning through iterative reweighting
with M-estimators, followed by a Nelder-Mead optimization of squared distance sums
to determine the best circle/cylinder parameters for a given point
cloud. The reweighting strategy used in \emph{TreeLS} is based on 
Liang et al. (2012). The Nelder-Mead algorithm implemented in Rcpp was provided by 
\href{https://github.com/kthohr/optim}{kthohr/optim}.

\section{Least Squares Cylinder Fit}{


\loadmathjax

The cylinder fit methods implemented in \emph{TreeLS} estimate a 3D
cylinder`s axis direction and radius. The algorithm used internally
to optimize the cylinder parameters is the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder-Mead_method}{Nelder-Mead simplex},
which takes as objective function the model describing the distance from any point
to a modelled cylinder`s surface on a regular 3D cylinder point cloud:

\mjdeqn{D_{p} = |(p - q) \times a| - r}{Dp = abs((p - q) x a) - r}

where:

\itemize{
   \item \emph{Dp}: distance from a point to the model cylinder`s surface
   \item \emph{p}: a point on the cylinder`s surface
   \item \emph{q}: a point on the cylinder`s axis
   \item \emph{a}: unit vector of cylinder`s direction
   \item \emph{r}: cylinder`s radius
}

The Nelder-Mead algorithm minimizes the sum of squared \emph{Dp} from
a set of points belonging to a stem segment - in the context of \emph{TreeLS}.

The parameters returned by the cylinder fit methods are:
\itemize{
   \item \code{rho,theta,phi,alpha}: 3D cylinder estimated axis parameters (Liang et al. 2012)
   \item \code{Radius}: 3D cylinder radius, in point cloud units
   \item \code{Error}: model cylinder error from the least squares fit
   \item \code{AvgHeight}: average height of the stem segment's points
   \item \code{N}: number of points belonging to the stem segment
   \item \code{PX,PY,PZ}: absolute center positions of the stem segment points, in point cloud units (used for plotting)
 }
