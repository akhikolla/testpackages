\title{Flexible GSL function}
\usage{
growing.season.length(daily.mean.temp, date.factor, dates, northern.hemisphere,
  min.length = 6, t.thresh = 5, gsl.mode = c("GSL", "GSL_first",
  "GSL_max", "GSL_sum"))
}
\arguments{
\item{daily.mean.temp}{Timeseries of daily mean temperature (in degrees C),
padded out to end on a year boundary (ie: starts on January 1st of some
year, ends on December 31st).}

\item{date.factor}{Factor of the same length as daily.mean.temp that divides
the timeseries up into years of data.}

\item{dates}{The corresponding series of dates.}

\item{northern.hemisphere}{Whether the data is from the northern hemisphere.}

\item{min.length}{The minimum number of days above or below the threshold
temperature that defines the start or end of a growing season.}

\item{t.thresh}{The temperature threshold for being considered part of a
growing season (in degrees C).}

\item{gsl.mode}{The growing season length mode (ETCCDI mode is "GSL").}
}
\value{
A vector containing the number of days in the growing season for
each year.
}
\description{
This function computes the growing season length (GSL) given the input,
which is allowed to vary considerably from the ETCCDI definitions.
}
\details{
This function is the function used to implement \code{\link{climdex.gsl}}.
It's designed to be flexible to allow for experimentation and testing of new
thresholds and methods.

If you need to use this code for experimentation in the southern hemisphere,
you'll need to rip off the climdex.gsl code to rotate the year around so
that July 1st is treated as January 1st.

See \code{\link{climdex.gsl}} for more information on what \code{gsl.mode}
does.

## Create a climdexInput object from some data already loaded in and
## ready to go.

## Parse the dates into PCICt.

prec.dates <- as.PCICt(do.call(paste, ec.1018935.prec[,c("year",
"jday")]), format="\%Y \%j", cal="gregorian")

## Load the data in.
ci <- climdexInput.raw(ec.1018935.tmax$MAX_TEMP,

tmax.dates, tmin.dates, prec.dates, base.range=c(1971, 2000))

## Create an annual timeseries of the growing season length in days.
gsl <- growing.season.length(ci@data$tavg, ci@date.factors$annual, ci@dates,
