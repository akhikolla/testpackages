\title{climdex.pcic, an implementation of the ETCCDI climate change indices.}
\description{
This package implements the ETCCDI's 27 core climate change indices
efficiently in R.
}
\details{
The calculation of climate extremes are important in many disciplines.
Annual maximum daily precipitation, annual maximum wind speed, and other
such extremes are used in many engineering applications. However, they are
not as useful when speaking about climate change.

The Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indicies (ETCCDI) has
created a set of 27 core indices with the intent of capturing the change in
the extremes of climate and in selected parameters deemed relevant to other
disciplines. These model the following types of parameters: \itemize{ \item
Shifts in the number of days where comparatively extreme conditions are
observed.  \item Growing season length.  \item 10th and 90th percentiles of
temperature versus baseline conditions.  \item Lengths of warm, cold, wet,
and dry spells.  \item Counts of days where precipitation exceeds a
threshold.  \item Total precipitation where precipitation exceeds the 95th
or 99th percentile of the baseline.  }

The \code{climdex.pcic} package provides an implementation of the ETCCDI's
27 core climate change indices. It aims to be reasonably high performance,
to handle non-Gregorian calendar types, to be as correct as possible given
the definitions of the indices, and to have sufficiently readable and
concise code as to facilitate easy verification by inspection.
