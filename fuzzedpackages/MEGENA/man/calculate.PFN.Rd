\title{
PFN calculation
}
\description{
main function to calculate PFN a ranked list of edge pairs
}
\usage{
calculate.PFN(edgelist,max.skipEdges = NULL,maxENum = NULL,doPar = FALSE,
num.cores = NULL,keep.track = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{edgelist}{three column edgelist: first two columns are topological edges, and the third column is the weight. Must be a data.frame object.}
  \item{max.skipEdges}{Maximum number of edges to be searched by planarity test without any inclusion to PFN. 
  If set NULL, it will be automatically set to number of cores x 1000. 
  It acts as a threhold to quicken PFN construction termination during PCP.}
  \item{maxENum}{maximum number of edges to include in final PFN. Default value is NULL, 
  which invokes maximal number of edges allowed in planar network.}
  \item{doPar}{TRUE/FALSE logical variable to choose parallelization.}
  \item{num.cores}{number of cores to use in parallelization.}
  \item{keep.track}{If TRUE, pfg_el.RData will be created in working folder. This file can be used later for restart in case PFN construction did not finish successfully.
  Default is TRUE.}
}
\details{
If \code{doPar = TRUE}, then num.cores are registered for PCP. 
}
\value{
 output is three column edgelist data.frame, third column being the weight.
