Title: Incremental Graphlet Counting for Network Optimisation
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2017-10-02
Author: Robrecht Cannoodt

Description: An efficient and incremental approach for calculating 
    the differences in orbit counts when performing single edge modifications 
    in a network. Calculating the differences in orbit counts is much more efficient than
    recalculating all orbit counts from scratch for each time point.
