\usage{
\S4method{compare_distributions}{color_class}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{color_class object.}

\item{...}{fit2 - a second color_class object, rgb - color defined through rgb, hsv - color defined through rgb, rope - region of practical equivalence, pars - components of comparison, a subset of (r, g, b, h, s, v).}
}
\value{
Comparison results or an error if something went wrong.
}
\description{
\code{compare_distributions} draws samples from distribution of the first group and compares them against samples drawn from the distribution of the second group or against a color defined with rgb or hsv components. You can also provide the rope parameter or execute the comparison only through chosen color components (r, g, b, h, s, v).

\examples{
# to use the function you first have to prepare the data and fit the model
# see class documentation for an example of the whole process
# along with an example of how to use this function
