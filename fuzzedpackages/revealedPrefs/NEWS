** New in v0.4
* Removed the 'deep' method for GARP detection.

** New in v0.3
*  Corrected an error in WARP detection.
*  Corrected an error in depth-first SARP detection.
*  Fixed a bug that made depth-first GARP detection slow in case of equalities.

** New in v0.2
*  Added functions simPrefs, simWarp, simSarp, simGarp for data simulation.
*  Added the Afriat parameter to all functions, to allow some level of decision error.
*  Fixed a bug in deepSarp algorithm, which could be fooled by a nonstrict preference loop.
