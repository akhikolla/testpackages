\title{Write eigenstrat *.ind files}
\usage{
write_ind(file, tib, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Output file (whatever is accepted by readr::write_tsv).
If file is missing the expected *.ind extension, the function adds it.}

\item{tib}{The tibble or data.frame to write.
It must contain these columns: id, sex, label.
Throws an error if any of these columns are missing.
Additional columns are ignored.
Columns are automatically reordered in output as expected in format.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE (default) function reports the path of the file being written (after autocompleting the extension).}
}
\value{
The output \code{tib} invisibly (what readr::write_tsv returns).
}
\description{
This function writes a tibble with the right columns into a standard eigenstrat *.ind file.
It uses readr::write_tsv to do it efficiently.
}
\examples{
# create a dummy tibble with the right columns
library(tibble)
tib <- tibble(
    id = 1:3,
    sex = 1,
    label = 1
)
# a dummy file
file_out <- tempfile('delete-me-example', fileext = '.ind') # will also work without extension
# write the table out in *.ind format (no header, columns in right order)
write_ind(file_out, tib)
# delete output when done
file.remove(file_out)
