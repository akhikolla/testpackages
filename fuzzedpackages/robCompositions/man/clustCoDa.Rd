  ...,
  normalized = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{compositional data represented as a data.frame}

\item{k}{number of clusters}

\item{method}{clustering method. One of Mclust, cmeans, kmeansHartigan,
cmeansUfcl, pam, clara, fanny, ward.D2, single, hclustComplete, 
average, mcquitty, median, centroid}

\item{scale}{if orthonormal coordinates should be normalized.}

\item{transformation}{default are the isometric logratio coordinates. Can only used when distMethod 
is not Aitchison.}

\item{distMethod}{Distance measure to be used. If \dQuote{Aitchison}, then transformation should be \dQuote{identity}.}

\item{iter.max}{parameter if kmeans is chosen. The maximum number of iterations allowed}

\item{vals}{if cluster validity measures should be calculated}

\item{alt}{a known partitioning can be provided (for special cluster validity measures)}

\item{bic}{if TRUE then the BIC criteria is evaluated for each single cluster as validity measure}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE additional print output is provided}

\item{y}{the y coordinates of points in the plot, optional if x is an appropriate structure.}

\item{...}{additional parameters for print method passed through}

\item{normalized}{results gets normalized before plotting. Normalization is done by z-transformation 
applied on each variable.}

\item{which.plot}{currently the only plot. Plot of cluster centers.}

\item{measure}{cluster validity measure to be considered for which.plot equals \dQuote{partMeans}}
}
\value{
all relevant information such as cluster centers, cluster memberships, and
cluster statistics.

\description{
Clustering in orthonormal coordinates or by using the Aitchison distance
}
\details{
The compositional data set is either internally represented by orthonormal coordiantes
before a cluster algorithm is applied, or - depending on the 
choice of parameters -  the Aitchison distance is used.
