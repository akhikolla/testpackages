\item{x}{compositional data}

a cut-off value for outlier identification: observations with larger
(squared) robust Mahalanobis distance are considered as potential outliers.}

according the MCD-estimator for which the determinant is minimized, see \code{\link[robustbase]{covMcd}}.}

\item{coda}{if TRUE, data transformed to coordinate representation before outlier detection.}

2 ... distance-distance plot}

\description{
Outlier detection for compositional data using standard and robust
statistical methods.
}
\details{
The outlier detection procedure is based on (robust) Mahalanobis distances
in isometric logratio coordinates.  Observations with
squared Mahalanobis distance greater equal a certain quantile of the
chi-squared distribution are marked as outliers.

If method \dQuote{robust} is chosen, the outlier detection is based on the
homogeneous majority of the compositional data set. If method
\dQuote{standard} is used, standard measures of location and scatter are
applied during the outlier detection procedure.

plot method: the Mahalanobis distance are plotted against the index.
The dashed line indicates the (1 - alpha) quantile of the chi-squared
distribution. Observations with Mahalanobis distance greater than this
quantile could be considered as compositional outliers.
}
\note{
It is highly recommended to use the robust version of the procedure.
