Description: Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of extreme value
    models.  The 'rust' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust> is
    used to simulate a random sample from the required posterior distribution.
    The functionality of 'revdbayes' is similar to the 'evdbayes' package
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=evdbayes>, which uses Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo ('MCMC') methods for posterior simulation.  Also provided
    are functions for making inferences about the extremal index, using 
    the K-gaps model of Suveges and Davison (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292>.
    Also provided are d,p,q,r functions for the Generalised Extreme Value 
    ('GEV') and Generalised Pareto ('GP') distributions that deal 
    appropriately with cases where the shape parameter is very close to zero.
