abstract="Improvements to the conventional ratio-of-uniforms method for random variate generation are proposed. A generalized radio-of-uniforms method is introduced, and it is demonstrated that relocation of the required density via the mode can greatly improve the computational efficiency of the method. We describe a multivariate version of the basic method and summarize a general strategy for efficient ratio-of-uniforms generation. Illustrative examples are given.",

     abstract = {In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, ..., y<sub>n</sub> are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters Î¸. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

Specifically, power transformations of the original variables are estimated to effect both marginal and joint normality. A method for improving directional normality is also described.

 abstract = {A fully Bayesian analysis of linear and non-linear population models has previously been unavailable, as a consequence of the seeming impossibility of performing the necessary numerical integrations in the complex multiparameter structures that typically arise in such models. It is demonstrated that, for a variety of linear and non-linear population models, a fully Bayesian analysis can be implemented in a straightforward manner by using the Gibbs sampler. The approach is illustrated with examples involving challenging problems of outliers and mean-variance relationships in population modelling.},
