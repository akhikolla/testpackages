\title{Tests of rotational symmetry for hyperspherical data}
\usage{
test_rotasym(data, theta = spherical_mean, type = c("sc", "loc", "loc_vMF",
  "hyb", "hyb_vMF")[5], Fisher = FALSE, U = NULL, V = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{hyperspherical data, a matrix of size \code{c(n, p)} with unit
norm rows. Normalized internally if any row does not have unit norm
(with a \code{warning} message). \code{NA}s are ignored.}

\item{theta}{either a unit norm vector of size \code{p} giving the axis of
rotational symmetry (for the specified-\eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta}
case) or a function that implements an estimator
\eqn{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}{\hat \theta} of
\eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta} (for the
unspecified-\eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta} case). The default calls
the \code{\link{spherical_mean}} function. See examples.}

\item{type}{a character string (case insensitive) indicating the type of
test to conduct:
\itemize{
\item \code{"sc"}: "scatter" test based on the statistic
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{sc}}}{Q_\theta^{sc}}. Evaluates if the
covariance matrix of the multivariate signs is isotropic.
\item \code{"loc"}: "location" test based on the statistic
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{loc}}}{Q_\theta^{loc}}. Evaluates if
the expectation of the multivariate signs is zero.
\item \code{"loc_vMF"}: adapted "location" test, based on the statistic
\eqn{Q_{\mathrm{vMF}}^{\mathrm{loc}}}{Q_{vMF}^{loc}}.
\item \code{"hyb"}: "hybrid" test based on the statistics
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{sc}}}{Q_\theta^{sc}} and
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{loc}}}{Q_\theta^{loc}}.
\item \code{"hyb_vMF"} (default): adapted "hybrid" test based on the
statistics \eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{sc}}}{Q_\theta^{sc}} and
\eqn{Q_{\mathrm{vMF}}^{\mathrm{loc}}}{Q_{vMF}^{loc}}.
}
See the details below for further explanations of the tests.}

\item{Fisher}{if \code{TRUE}, then Fisher's method is employed to aggregate
the scatter and location tests in the hybrid test, see details below.
Otherwise, the hybrid statistic is the sum of the scatter and location
statistics. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{U}{\emph{multivariate signs} of \code{data}, a matrix of size
\code{c(n, p - 1)}. Computed if \code{NULL} (the default).}

\item{V}{\emph{cosines} of \code{data}, a vector of size \code{n}. Computed
if \code{NULL} (the default).}
}
\value{
An object of the \code{htest} class with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{statistic}: test statistic.
\item \code{parameter}: degrees of freedom of the chi-square distribution
appearing in all the null asymptotic distributions.
\item \code{p.value}: \eqn{p}-value of the test.
\item \code{method}: information on the type of test performed.
\item \code{data.name}: name of the value of \code{data}.
\item \code{U}: multivariate signs of \code{data}.
\item \code{V}: cosines of \code{data}.

\description{
Tests for assessing the rotational symmetry of a unit-norm
random vector \eqn{\mathbf{X}}{X} in
\eqn{S^{p-1}:=\{\mathbf{x}\in R^p:||\mathbf{x}||=1\}}{
S^{p-1} := \{x \in R^p : ||x|| = 1\}}, \eqn{p \ge 2}, about a location
\eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}\in S^{p-1}}{\theta \in S^{p-1}}, from a
hyperspherical sample \eqn{\mathbf{X}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{X}_n\in S^{p-1}}{
X_1, \ldots, X_n \in S^{p-1}}.

The vector \eqn{\mathbf{X}}{X} is said to be rotational symmetric about
\eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta} if the distributions of
\eqn{\mathbf{OX}}{OX} and \eqn{\mathbf{X}}{X} coincide, where
\eqn{\mathbf{O}}{O} is any \eqn{p\times p}{p x p} rotation matrix
that fixes \eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta}, \emph{i.e.},
\eqn{\mathbf{O}\boldsymbol{\theta}=\boldsymbol{\theta}}{O\theta = \theta}.
}
\details{
Descriptions of the tests:
\itemize{
\item The "scatter" test is locally and asymptotically optimal against
\link[=tangent-elliptical]{tangent elliptical} alternatives to rotational
symmetry. However, it is not consistent against
\link[=tangent-vMF]{tangent von Mises--Fisher} (vMF) alternatives.
The asymptotic null distribution of
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{sc}}}{Q_\theta^{sc}}
is unaffected if \eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta} is estimated, that is,
the asymptotic null distributions of
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{sc}}}{Q_\theta^{sc}} and
\eqn{Q_{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}^{\mathrm{sc}}}{Q_{\hat \theta}^{sc}} are
the same.
\item The "location" test is locally and asymptotically most powerful
against vMF alternatives to rotational symmetry. However, it is not
consistent against tangent elliptical alternatives. The asymptotic
null distribution of
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{loc}}}{Q_\theta^{loc}}
for known \eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta} (the one implemented in
\code{test_rotasym}) \emph{does change} if \eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta}
is estimated by \eqn{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}{\hat \theta}. Therefore, if
the test is performed with an estimated \eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta}
(if \code{theta} is a function)
\eqn{Q_{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}^{\mathrm{loc}}}{Q_{\hat \theta}^{loc}}
will not be properly calibrated. \code{test_rotasym} will give a warning in
such case.
\item The "vMF location" test is a modification of the "location" test
designed to make its null asymptotic distribution invariant from the
estimation of \eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\theta} (as the "scatter" test is).
The test is optimal against tangent vMF alternatives with a \emph{specific},
vMF-based, angular function \code{\link{g_vMF}}. Despite not
being optimal against all tangent vMF alternatives, it is
consistent for all of them. As the location test,
it is not consistent against tangent elliptical alternatives.
\item The "hybrid" test combines (see below how) the "scatter" and
"location" tests. The test is neither optimal against tangent elliptical nor
tangent vMF alternatives, but it is consistent against both. Since it is
based on the "location" test, if computed with an estimator
\eqn{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}{\hat \theta}, the test statistic will not
be properly calibrated. \code{test_rotasym} will give a warning in such case.
\item The "vMF hybrid" test is the analogous of the "hybrid" test but
replaces the "location" test by the "vMF location" test.
}

The combination of the scatter and location tests in the hybrid tests is
done in two different ways:
\itemize{
\item If \code{Fisher = FALSE}, then the scatter and location tests
statistics give the hybrid test statistic
\deqn{Q^{\mathrm{hyb}}:=Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{sc}}+
Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{loc}}.}{
Q_\theta^{hyb} := Q_\theta^{sc} + Q_\theta^{loc}.}
\item If \code{Fisher = TRUE}, then Fisher's method for aggregating
independent tests (the two test statistics are independent under rotational
symmetry) is considered, resulting the hybrid test statistic:
\deqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{hyb}}
:=-2(\log(p_{\mathrm{sc}})+\log(p_{\mathrm{loc}}))}{
Q_\theta^{hyb} := -2(log(p_{sc}) + log(p_{loc}))}
where \eqn{p_{\mathrm{sc}}}{p_{sc}} and \eqn{p_{\mathrm{loc}}}{p_{loc}} are
the \eqn{p}-values of the scatter and location tests, respectively.
}
The hybrid test statistic \eqn{Q_{\mathrm{vMF}}^{\mathrm{hyb}}}{
Q_{vMF}^{hyb}} follows analogously to
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{hyb}}}{Q_\theta^{hyb}} by replacing
\eqn{Q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\mathrm{loc}}}{Q_\theta^{loc}} with
\eqn{Q_{\mathrm{vMF}}^{\mathrm{loc}}}{Q_{vMF}^{loc}}.

Finally, recall that the tests are designed to test \emph{implications} of
rotational symmetry. Therefore, the tests are not consistent against
\emph{all} types of alternatives to rotational symmetry.
