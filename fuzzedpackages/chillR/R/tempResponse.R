#' Calculation of climatic metrics from hourly temperature records
#' 
#' Extension of the chilling function, which calculated four pre-defined
#' temperature-based metrics. This function has more flexibility, because it
#' allows specifying the models that should be calculated. These can be
#' selected from a small set of models provided with chillR, but they can also
#' be defined by the user. Precondition at the moment is that they require
#' hourly temperature only as inputs.
#' 
#' The function calculates the total of user-specified temperature-based
#' metrics over periods delineated by Start_JDay and End_JDay. Models for
#' calculating these metrics are provided in the models list, whose elements
#' are named functions that convert hourly temperature records into a
#' cumulative record of the climate metric of interest. The metric is then
#' added up cumulatively over the entire temperature record and then summarized
#' by season. Examples of functions that can be used are Chilling_Hours,
#' Utah_Model, Dynamic_Model and GDH. The custom_model function allows
#' customized simply weight-based models, which assign differential weights to
#' temperatures within certain intervals. See custom_model documentation for
#' details.
#' 
#' @param hourtemps a list of two elements, with element 'hourtemps' being a
#' dataframe of hourly temperatures (e.g. produced by stack_hourly_temps). This
#' data frame must have a column for Year, a column for JDay (Julian date, or
#' day of the year), a column for Hour and a column for Temp (hourly
#' temperature). The second (optional) element is QC, which is a data.frame
#' indicating completeness of the dataset. This is automatically produced by
#' stack_hourly_temps.
#' @param Start_JDay the start date (in Julian date, or day of the year) of the
#' period, for which chill and heat should be quantified.
#' @param End_JDay the end date (in Julian date, or day of the year) of the
#' period, for which chill and heat should be quantified.
#' @param models named list of models that should be applied to the hourly
#' temperature data. These should be functions that take as input a vector of
#' hourly temperatures. This defaults to the set of models provided by the
#' chilling function.
#' @param misstolerance maximum percentage of values for a given season that
#' can be missing without the record being removed from the output. Defaults to
#' 50.
#' @param whole_record boolean parameter indicating whether the metrics should
#' be summed over the entire temperature record. If set to TRUE (default is
#' FALSE), then the function ignores the specified start and end dates and
#' simply returns the totals of each metric that accumulated over the entire
#' temperature record.
#' @param mean_out boolean parameter indicating whether the mean of the input
#' metric (e.g. temperature) should be returned in a column named "Input_mean".
#' @return data frame showing totals for all specified models for the
#' respective periods for all seasons included in the temperature records.
#' Columns are Season, End_year (the year when the period ended) and Days (the
#' duration of the period), as well as one column per model, which receives the
#' same name as the function in the models list. If the weather input consisted
#' of a list with elements stack and QC, the output also contains columns from
#' QC that indicate the completeness of the weather record that the
#' calculations are based on.
