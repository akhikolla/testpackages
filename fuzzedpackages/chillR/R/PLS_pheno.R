#' Partial Least Squares analysis of phenology vs. daily mean temperatures
#' 
#' This function conducts a Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression analysis
#' relating an annual biological phenomenon, e.g. fruit tree flowering or leaf
#' emergence, to mean daily temperatures of the preceding 12 months. It
#' produces figures that illustrate statistical correlations between
#' temperature variation during certain phases and the timing of phenological
#' event.
#' 
#' PLS regression is useful for exploring the relationship between daily
#' temperature data and biological phenomena that only occur once per year. The
#' statistical challenge is that a normally quite small number of observations
#' must be related to variation in a much larger number (365) of daily
#' temperatures, which are also highly autocorrelated. Most regression
#' approaches are not suitable for this, but PLS regression offers a potential
#' solution. The method is frequently used in chemometrics and hyperspectral
#' remote sensing, where similar statistical challenges are encountered. The
#' basic mechanism is that PLS first constructs latent factors (similar to
#' principal components) from the independent data (temperatures) and then uses
#' these components for the regression. The contribution of each individual
#' variable to the PLS model is then evaluated with two main metrics: the
#' Variable Importance in the Projection statistic (VIP) indicates how much
#' variation in a given independent variable is correlated with variation in
#' the dependent variable. A threshold of 0.8 is often used for determining
#' importance. The standardized model coefficients of the PLS model then give
#' an indication of the direction and strength of the effect, e.g. if
#' coefficients are positive and high, high values for the respective
#' independent variable are correlated with high values of the dependent
#' variable (e.g. late occurrence of a phenological stage). This procedure was
#' inspired by the challenge of explaining variation in bloom and leaf
#' emergence dates of temperate fruit trees in Mediterranean climates. These
#' are generally understood to result from (more of less) sequential
#' fulfillment of a chilling and a forcing requirement. During the chilling
#' phase, cool temperatures are needed; during the forcing phase, trees need
#' heat. There is no easily visible change in tree buds that would indicate the
#' transition between these two phases, making it difficult to develop a good
#' model of these processes. Where long-term phenology data are available and
#' can be couple with daily temperature records, PLS regression allows
#' detection of the chilling/forcing transition. This procedure has not often
#' been applied to biological phenomena at the time of writing this, and there
#' may be constraints to how generally applicable it is. Yet is has passed the
#' test of scientific peer review a few times, and it has produced plausible
#' results in a number of settings. This package draws heavily from the pls
#' package. It also incorporates very helpful comments from Sabine Guesewell of
#' ETH Zurich (Switzerland), who pointed out some errors in the PLS procedure
#' and made suggestions for improvement.
#' 
#' @param weather_data a dataframe containing daily minimum and maximum
#' temperature data (in columns called Tmin and Tmax, respectively), and/or
#' mean daily temperature (in a column called Tmean). There also has to be a
#' column for Year and one for JDay (the Julian date, or day of the year).
#' Alternatively, the date can also be given in three columns (Years, Month and
#' Day).
#' @param bio_data a data frame that contains information on the timing of
#' phenological events by year. It should consist of two columns called Year
#' and pheno. Data in the pheno column should be in Julian date (day of the
#' year).
#' @param split_month the procedure analyzes data by phenological year, which
#' can start and end in any month during the calendar year (currently only at
#' the beginning of a month). This variable indicates the last month (e.g. 5
#' for May) that should be included in the record for a given phenological
#' year. All subsequent months are assigned to the following phenological year.
#' @param runn_mean application of a running mean function to daily mean
#' temperatures before running the PLS procedure substantially enhances the
#' clarity of outputs. runn_mean requires an odd integer value specifying how
#' many days should be included in this running mean. runn_mean=11 has usually
#' produced good results.
#' @param expl.var percentage of the variation in the dependent variable that
#' the PLS model should explain. This is used as a threshold in finding the
#' appropriate number of components in the PLS regression procedure.
#' @param ncomp.fix fixed number of components for the PLS model. Defaults to
#' NULL, so that the number is automatically determined, but is can also be set
#' by the user.
#' @param use_Tmean boolean variable indicating whether or not the column Tmean
#' from the weather_data_frame should be used as input for the PLS analysis. If
#' this is set to FALSE, Tmean is calculated as the arithmetic mean of Tmin and
#' Tmax.
#' @param return.all boolean variable indicating whether or not the full set of
#' PLS results should be output from the function. If this is set to TRUE, the
#' function output is a list with two elements: PLS_summary and PLS_output; if
#' it is set to FALSE, only the PLS_summary is returned.
#' @param crossvalidate character variable indicating what kind of validation
#' should be performed by the PLS procedure. This defaults to "none", but the
#' plsr function (of the pls package) also takes "CV" and "LOO" as inputs. See
#' the documentation for the plsr function for details.
#' @param end_at_pheno_end boolean variable indicating whether the analysis
#' should disregard temperatures after the last date included in the
#' bio_data_frame dataset. If set to TRUE, only temperatures up this date are
#' considered. Phenology data is extracted from the PLS output files. If this
#' parameter is assigned a numeric value, only data up to the Julian date
#' specified by this number are considered.
#' @return \item{object_type}{ the character string "PLS_Temp_pheno". This is
#' only needed for choosing the correct method for the plot_PLS function.}
#' \item{pheno}{ a data frame containing the phenology data used for the PLS
#' regression, with columns Year and pheno.} \item{PLS_summary}{ a data frame
#' containing all important outputs of the PLS regression. Columns are Date (in
#' MMDD format), JDay (Julian date, or day of the year), Coefficient (the PLS
#' model coefficient for each daily temperature variable), and VIP (the
#' Variable Importance in the Projection score). The columns Tmean and Tstdev
#' contain the means and standard deviations of temperature for each day of the
#' year.} \item{PLS_output}{ this is the complete output of the plsr function
#' of the pls package. See the documentation for that package for further
#' details.}
