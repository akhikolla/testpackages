/* Reason behind this file: Cython (as of v0.29) will not auto-deallocate
   structs which are part of a cdef'd class, which produces a memory leak
   but can be force-destructed. Unfortunately, Cython itself doesn't even
   allow calling destructors for structs, so it has to be done externally.
   These functions should otherwise have no reason to be. */
