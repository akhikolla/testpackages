\title{Simulate SEER cancers and population person years}
\description{Simulates data for two cancers, A and B. }
\usage{simSeerSet(N=2e9,yearEnd=2016,ka=1e-5,kb=0.04,Ab=1e-5,
                 tauA=10,tauB=1,delay=1,period=4)} 
\arguments{
  \item{N}{Number of person years to simulate. Default is roughly that of SEER. }
  \item{yearEnd}{Most recent SEER year to simulate. }
  \item{ka}{Rate at which cancer A incidence increases linearly with age. }
  \item{kb}{Exponential aging rate constant for cancer B incidence. }
  \item{Ab}{Exponential amplitude for cancer B incidence. }
  \item{tauA}{Survival mean in years for cancer A. }
  \item{tauB}{Survival mean in years for cancer B. }
%  \item{Rba}{The risk of B given A. This constant is assumed to be independent of age and year. 
%  Latencies are assumed to follow a beta distribution between 0 and 5 years with a peak at just under 4 years.},
  \item{delay}{Years until the beginning of the excess risk of B. }
  \item{period}{Duration in Years of the excess risk of B. }
%  \item{shape}{Beta distribution shape paramaters are both set to this. Higher implies more peaked. },
}

\value{A simulated seerSet object with popsa filled using US 2000 Std population proportions and canc with 
cancers A and B
where the incidence of A increases linearly with age and B increase exponentially in age.
Survival times are assumed to be exponentially distributed with means of tauA years for A and tauB years for B.
Radiation therapy of A is assumed to increase RR of B to 5 uniformly for \code{period} years after \code{delay} years.}
