Description: Provides implementation of the generic composite similarity measure
    (GCSM) described in Liu et al. (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101169>. The
    implementation is in C++ and uses 'RcppArmadillo'. Additionally, implementations
    of the structural similarity (SSIM) and the composite similarity measure based
    on means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficient (CMSC), are included.
