# Version 1.0.8 (2020-09-28)

-- Fixed bare returns without parentheses.

# Version 1.0.7 (2020-05-19)

# Version 1.0.6 (2020-05-12)

-- Mega2pedgene updated to work with updated version of pedgene.

# Version 1.0.5 (2019-02-27)

# Version 1.0.4 (2018-06-18)

-- Improvements to use compressed data created by Mega2 version 5.0.0 or higher.
