  XBRL has been developed on a Gentoo 64 bits Linux platform. 32 bits
  systems should not make any difference. It should work in other *nix
  variants, including OS X, with little or no modification of location
  of include files and libraries.

  Binary packages for Windows, both 32 and 64 bits, have been
  successfully built in winbuilder (http://win-builder.r-project.org),
  as libxml2 is part of the Rtools standard library set
  (http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/libs.html)

  If you want to install XBRL in Windows from source, you will need to
  have a recent version of Rtools installed. You will also need to
  declare LIB_XML to point where libxml2 is installed.
