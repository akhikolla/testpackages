\arguments{
\item{species_tree}{species tree to simulate along}

\item{gbr}{gene birth rate}

\item{gdr}{gene death rate}

\item{lgtr}{gene transfer rate}

\item{num_loci}{number of locus trees to simulate}

\item{transfer_type}{The type of transfer input. Acceptable options: "cladewise" or "random"}
}
\value{
List of objects of the tree class (as implemented in APE)
}
\description{
Given a species tree simulates a locus or gene family tree along
    the species tree.
}
\details{
Given a species tree will perform a birth-death process coupled with transfer.
The simulation runs along the species tree speciating and going extinct in addition to locus tree birth and deaths.
Thus with parameters set to 0.0 a tree identical to the species tree is returned (it is relabel however).

Transfers are implemented as a birth-death process.
One descendant lineage retains its species identity the other gains a new identity.
At present, two types of transfers are implemented: "random" an "cladewise".
The random transfer mode transfers one randomly chooses a contemporaneous lineage.
Cladewise transfers choose lineages based on relatedness with more closely related lineages being more likely.
