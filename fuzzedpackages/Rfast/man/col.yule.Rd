\title{
Column-wise Yule's Y (coefficient of colligation)
}

\description{
Column-wise Yule's Y (coefficient of colligation).
}

\usage{
col.yule(x, y = NULL, ina)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with 0 and 1. Every column refers to a different sample or variable. 
}
\item{y}{
A second matrix, of the same dimensions as x, with 0 and 1. Every column refers to a different sample or variable. 
}
\item{ina}{
If y is NULL, ina must be specified. This is a numeric vector with 1s and 2s, indicating the group of each row.
}
}

\details{
Yule's coefficient of colligation is calculated for every column.
}

\value{
A vector with Yule's Y, one for every column of x is returned.
