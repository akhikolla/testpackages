\description{
Exact t-test for 2 independent samples.
}

\usage{
exact.ttest2(x, y)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numerical vector with the data.
}
\item{y}{
A numerical vector with the data.
}
}

\details{
This function performs an exact t-test. With few observations, permutation or bootstrap calculation
of the p-value is advisable. However, with even fewer observations, one can perform all possible 
permutations and calculate the exact p-value. This is what this function does. BUT, pay attention, 
as this works with few samples. If for example each sample contains 15 numbers, you will need a lot 
of memory (more than 17 GB) for this function to work. the reason is that we create the matrix with 
all possible permutations first and then perform the two-sample t-test. 
}

\value{
A vector with the number of permutations, test statistic and the permutation based p-value.
