\description{
Many hypothesis tests for two means of percentages.
}

\usage{
percent.ttests(x, y, logged = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A numericalmatrix with the percentages of the first sample. Any value between 0 and 1 
(inclusive) is allowed.
}
\item{y}{
A numerical matrix with the percentages of the first sample. Any value between 0 and 1 
(inclusive) is allowed.
} 
\item{logged}{
Should the p-values be returned (FALSE) or their logarithm (TRUE)?
}
}

\details{
This is the \code{\link{prop.reg}} but with a single categorical predictor which has two 
levels only. It is like a t-test for the means of two samples haivng percentages. 
}

\value{
A matrix with three columns, the phi parameter, the test statistic and its associated 
p-value.
