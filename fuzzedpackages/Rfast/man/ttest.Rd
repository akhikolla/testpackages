Many one sample tests
}

\description{
Many one sample tests.
}

\usage{
proptest(x, n, p, alternative = "unequal", logged = FALSE) 
ttest(x, m, alternative = "unequal", logged = FALSE, conf = NULL)
vartest(x, sigma, alternative = "unequal", logged = FALSE, conf = NULL) 
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with numerical data. Each column of the matrix corresponds to a sample, or a group. In the case of the "proptest" this is a vector integers ranging from 0 up to n. It is the number of "successes". 
}
\item{n}{
This is for the "proptest" only and is a vector with integer numbers specifying the number of tries for the proptest. Its size is equal to the size of x.
}
\item{p}{
A vector with the assumed probabilities of success in the "proptest". Its size is equal to the number of colums of the matrix x.
}
\item{m}{
A vector with the assumed means. Its size is equal to the number of colums of the matrix x.
}
\item{sigma}{
A vector with assumed variances. Its size is equal to the number of colums of the matrix x.
}
\item{alternative}{
The type of hypothesis to be checked. Equal to ("unequal"), grater than("greater") or less than ("less") the assumed parameter.
}
\item{logged}{
Should the p-values be returned (FALSE) or their logarithm (TRUE)?
}
\item{conf}{
If you want confidence intervals to be returned specify the confidence level, otherwise leave it NULL.
}
}

\details{
Despite the functions having been written in R, they are very fast.  
}

\value{
For all tests except for the "sftests" a matrix with two colums, the test statistic and the p-value respectively.
