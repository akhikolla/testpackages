Description: Perform mediation analysis in the presence of high-dimensional
    mediators based on the potential outcome framework. High dimensional
    Bayesian mediation (HDBM), developed by Song et al (2018)
    <doi:10.1101/467399>, relies on two Bayesian sparse linear mixed models to
    simultaneously analyze a relatively large number of mediators for a
    continuous exposure and outcome assuming a small number of mediators are
    truly active. This sparsity assumption also allows the extension of
    univariate mediator analysis by casting the identification of active
    mediators as a variable selection problem and applying Bayesian methods
    with continuous shrinkage priors on the effects.
