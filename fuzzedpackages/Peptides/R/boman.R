#' @title Compute the Boman (Potential Protein Interaction) index
#' @description This function computes the potential protein interaction index proposed by Boman (2003) based in the amino acid sequence of a protein. 
#' The index is equal to the sum of the solubility values for all residues in a sequence, it might give an overall estimate of the potential of a peptide to bind to membranes or other proteins as receptors, to normalize it is divided by the number of residues. 
#' A protein have high binding potential if the index value is higher than 2.48.
#'
#' @param seq An amino-acid sequence
#'
#' @return The computed potential protein-protein interaction for a given amino-acids sequence
#' @references Boman, H. G. (2003). Antibacterial peptides: basic facts and emerging concepts. Journal of Internal Medicine, 254(3), 197-215.
#' @details The potential protein interaction index was proposed by Boman (2003) as an easy way to differentiate the action mechanism of hormones (protein-protein) and antimicrobial peptides (protein-membrane) through this index. This function predicts the potential peptide interaction with another protein.
