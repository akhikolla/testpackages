\title{Compute the instability index of a protein sequence}
\usage{
instaIndex(seq)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq}{An amino-acids sequence}
}
\value{
The computed instability index for a given amino-acids sequence
}
\description{
This function calculates the instability index proposed by Guruprasad (1990). This index predicts the stability of a protein based on its amino acid composition, a protein whose instability index is smaller than 40 is predicted as stable, a value above 40 predicts that the protein may be unstable.

\examples{
# COMPARED TO ExPASy INSTAINDEX
# http://web.expasy.org/protparam/
# SEQUENCE: QWGRRCCGWGPGRRYCVRWC
# The instability index (II) is computed to be 83.68

instaIndex(seq = "QWGRRCCGWGPGRRYCVRWC")
# [1] 83.68
