\title{Compute the Cruciani properties of a protein sequence}
\usage{
crucianiProperties(seq)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq}{An amino-acids sequence}
}
\value{
The computed average of Cruciani properties of all the amino acids in the corresponding peptide sequence. Each PP represent an amino-acid property as follows: \itemize{\item{PP1:} Polarity, \item{PP2:} Hydrophobicity, \item{PP3:} H-bonding}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Cruciani properties of an amino-acids sequence using the scaled principal component scores that summarize a broad set of descriptors calculated based on the interaction of each amino acid residue with several chemical groups (or "probes"), such as charged ions, methyl, hydroxyl groups, and so forth.
