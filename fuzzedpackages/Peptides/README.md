Peptides 
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dosorio/Peptides.svg?branch=master)
![CRAN\_Download\_Badge](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/Peptides?color=green)
========
R package to calculate several physicochemical properties and indices for amino-acid sequences as well as to read and plot 'XVG' output files from the 'GROMACS' molecular dynamics package

Install
-------
This package required R version 1.2.2 or higher. If you are using an older version of R you will be prompted to upgrade when you try to install the package.

The official release of Peptides is available on CRAN. To install from CRAN, use the following command:
```
install.packages("Peptides", dependencies=TRUE)
```
If you have devtools installed, install the latest stable version this package directly from GitHub:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("dosorio/Peptides")
library(Peptides)
```
