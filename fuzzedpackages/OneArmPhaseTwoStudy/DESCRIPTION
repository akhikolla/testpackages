Description: Purpose of this package is it to plan, monitor and evaluate
    oncological phase II studies. In general this kind of studies are single-arm
    trials with planned interim analysis and binary endpoint. To meet the resulting
    requirements, the package provides functions to calculate and evaluate 'Simon's
    two-stage designs' and 'so-called' 'subset designs'. If you are unfamiliar with
    this package a good starting point is to take a closer look at the functions
    getSolutions() and getSolutionsSub1().The web-based tool (<https://imbi.shinyapps.io/phaseII-app/>)
    extends the functionality of our R package by means of a proper dealing with over- and underrunning.
    The R function binom.test of the 'stats' R package and the package 'binom' might be 
    helpful to assess the performance of the corresponding one-stage design as a reference.
