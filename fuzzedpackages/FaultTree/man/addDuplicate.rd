\title{ Add a duplicated (repeated) event or entire branch to a fault tree. }

\description{Modifies an existing fault tree with the addition of the repeated nodes.}

\usage{
addDuplicate(DF, at, dup_id=NULL, dup_of=NULL, display_under=NULL, 
		collapse=FALSE) 
}

\arguments{
\item{DF}{ A fault tree dataframe such as returned from ftree.make or related add... functions.}
\item{at}{ The ID of the parent node for this addition.}
\item{dup_id}{The ID or tag name of a component event or root node of a branch to be repeated in a fault tree. Must provide either dup_id or dup_of.}
\item{dup_of}{Alternative argument for the ID or tag name of a component event or root node of a branch to be repeated in a fault tree. If dup_id is provided, dup_of is ignored.}
\item{display_under}{Optionally, the ID of a sibling event under an OR gate for vertical alignment of
 only component nodes (MOE, not MOB) in the graphic display.}
\item{collapse}{A logical to determine whether a branch should be collapsed on initial view.}
}

\value{
Returns the input fault tree dataframe appended with a entry row(s) for the defined component event.
}

\details{
 This function is used to replicate the source event(s), not just copy for a similar item.
 Both the source and replicated nodes are notated in a MOE column of the fault tree dataframe.
 This notation will be used by future minimal cut set determination. Additionally, future
 editing functions can be notified and likely blocked on these items.
