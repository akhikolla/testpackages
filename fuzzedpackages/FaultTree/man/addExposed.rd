\title{ Add a Time Dependant, Non-Repairable, Event }

\description{Adds a basic component event to a fault tree in which probability of failure 
 is defined by a probability distribution and exposure time.}

\usage{
addExposed(DF, at, mttf, dist="exponential", param=NULL, display_under=NULL,
		tag="", exposure=NULL, label="", name="",name2="", description="")
}

\arguments{
\item{DF}{ A fault tree dataframe such as returned from ftree.make or related add... functions.}
\item{at}{ The ID or tag name of the parent node for this addition.}
\item{mttf}{The mean time to failure.  It is the user's responsibility to maintain constant units of time.}
\item{dist}{The probabilty distribution to be used for defining probability of failure from mttf, and a possible extra parameter. Options for "exponential" and "weibull" have been implemented.}
\item{param}{A vector containing shape and time_shift for weibull exposed events in that order.}
\item{display_under}{Optionally, the ID of a sibling event under an OR gate for vertical alignment of the component node in the graphic display.}
\item{tag}{ A very short identifying string (typically 5 characters or less) uniquely identifying a basic event for minimal cutset evaluation}
\item{exposure}{This is to be a seldom-used override of system mission time applicable only to exponentially exposed events.}
\item{label}{An identifying string for the logic gate. Use of label in ftree.make defines the convention for rest of tree construction.}
\item{name}{ A short identifying string  (typically less than 24 characters)}
\item{name2}{ A second line, if needed for the identifying string label}
\item{description}{ An optional string providing more detail for this probability.}
}

\value{
Returns the input fault tree dataframe appended with an entry row for the defined failure event.
}

\details{
The lambda for exponential definition is taken as 1/mttf, which is the value stored in CFR for the tree node.
Weibull distributions have a mean, which differs from the classical scale parameter by a factor determined as gamma(1+1/shape).
The weibull scale is determined from the value stored in CFR (as 1/mttf) for the tree node. Additional parameters to fully define
the specific distribution of expected failure times are the shape and any time_shift.
