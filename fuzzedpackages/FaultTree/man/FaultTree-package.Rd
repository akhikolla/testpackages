Fault Trees for Risk and Reliability Analysis

\description{
A package for constructing,calculating and displaying fault trees.

}

\section{Introduction}{
	\pkg{FaultTree} provides functions for building tree structures as dataframe objects.
	The fault tree incorporates logic nodes (primarily AND and OR) which process input 
	and may direct output "upwards" through the tree structure.  Data is entered through
	component entries.  Component event entries may be active (failures immediately 
	revealed) or dormant (failures remain hidden until activation or inspection).  
	The fault tree may also accept pure probability or pure demand input components.
