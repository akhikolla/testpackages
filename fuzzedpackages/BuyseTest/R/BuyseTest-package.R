#' @description Implementation of the Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. 
#' \code{\link{BuyseTest}} is the main function of the package. See the vignette of an overview of the functionalities of the package.
#' Run \code{citation("BuyseTest")} in R for how to cite this package in scientific publications.
#' See the section reference below for examples of application in clinical studies.

#' @details
#' The Generalized Pairwise Comparisons form all possible pairs of observations,
#' one observation being taken from the intervention group and the other is taken from the control group,
#' and compare the value of their endpoints.
#'
#' If the difference in endpoint value between the two observations of the pair is greater than the threshold of clinical relevance, the pair
#' is classified as favorable (i.e. win). If the difference is lower than minus the threshold of clinical relevance the pair is classified as unfavorable (i.e. loss).
#' Otherwise the pair is classified as neutral. In presence of censoring, it might not be possible to compare the difference to the threshold. In such cases the pair
#' is classified as uninformative.
#' 
#' Simultaneously analysis of several endpoints is performed by prioritizing the endpoints, assigning the highest priority to the endpoint considered the most clinically relevant.
#' The endpoint with highest priority is analyzed first, and neutral and uninformative pair are analyzed regarding endpoint of lower priority.
