        now bold.
    * src/bestRound.h: It was fixed a deprecated statement for the
        armadillo function `stable_sort_index`.
    * src/intCalib.h: The initialization of the vector
        `colvec s(w.size());` in the function `IntProgCalib` was
        substitute with `colvec s(y.size());`. It was fixed a

        armadillo function `stable_sort_index`.
    * src/Losses/LB1.h: It was fixed a deprecated statement for the
        armadillo function `stable_sort_index`.
    * src/Losses/rB1.h: It was fixed a deprecated statement for the
        armadillo function `stable_sort_index`.
    * src/Losses/rL1.h: It was fixed a deprecated statement for the
