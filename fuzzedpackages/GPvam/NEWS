Version 3.0-5: 2018-04-18
	- Minor updates to package structure to conform with new CRAN requirements.

Version 3.0-4: 2017-03-15
	- Minor updates to package structure to conform with new CRAN requirements
          related to compiled C++ code.

Version 3.0-3: 2015-07-19
	- Minor updates to package structure to conform with new CRAN requirements.

Version 3.0-2: 2014-06-22
	
	- Changed method used to calculate rank of X matrix to 
	  avoid conversion to a dense matrix.

	- Added information to documentation about program run time.

	- Added data set GPvam.benchmark, which contains program run time
	  and memory requirements for various simulated data sets.

	- Changed default options to Hessian=FALSE and verbose=TRUE.

Version 3.0-1: 2014-01-31
	
	- Corrected use of 'break' reserved word

Version 3.0-0: 2014-01-30
	
	- The program runs much faster now with student.side="R"
	  due to the use of Rcpp and RcppArmadillo and a re-ordered
	  nested loop.

	- Added references to recently accepted papers in
          help files.

Version 2.0-0: 2012-07-05
	
	- Improved scalability of program when student.side="R". 
	  For smaller data sets, certain operations work faster 
	  with dense matrices, but these matrices grow in size 
	  with the data. For large data sets, we now rely 
	  exclusively on sparse matrices.

	- Added support for the variable persistence (VP) model,
	  including the ability to estimate the persistence 
	  parameters. As special cases, the complete and zero 
	  persistence models have also been included.

Version 1.1-0: 2012-04-03

	- Corrected issue where program crashed when updated
          covariance matrix was not symmetric due to rounding
          (i.e. transposed compoenents may have differered by
          1E-14 or so).
        
        - Added caterpillar plots to plot() output.


Version 1.0-0: 2012-02-19

        - First public release.
