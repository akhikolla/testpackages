\usage{
diagnostics(obj, diags = c("dic", "dinf", "waic"),
  keepDeviance = FALSE, keepPPD = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{\link{spCP}} model object for which diagnostics
are desired from.}

\item{diags}{A vector of character strings indicating the diagnostics to compute.
Options include: Deviance Information Criterion ("dic"), d-infinity ("dinf") and
Watanabe-Akaike information criterion ("waic"). At least one option must be included.
Note: The probit model cannot compute the DIC or WAIC diagnostics due to computational
issues with computing the multivariate normal CDF.}

\item{keepDeviance}{A logical indicating whether the posterior deviance distribution
is returned (default = FALSE).}

\item{keepPPD}{A logical indicating whether the posterior predictive distribution
at each observed location is returned (default = FALSE).}
}
\value{
\code{diagnostics} returns a list containing the diagnostics requested and
 possibly the deviance and/or posterior predictive distribution objects.
}
\description{
Calculates diagnostic metrics using output from the \code{\link{spCP}} model.

\details{
To assess model fit, DIC, d-infinity and WAIC are used. DIC is based on the
 deviance statistic and penalizes for the complexity of a model with an effective
 number of parameters estimate pD (Spiegelhalter et al 2002). The d-infinity posterior
 predictive measure is an alternative diagnostic tool to DIC, where d-infinity=P+G.
 The G term decreases as goodness of fit increases, and P, the penalty term, inflates
 as the model becomes over-fit, so small values of both of these terms and, thus, small
 values of d-infinity are desirable (Gelfand and Ghosh 1998). WAIC is invariant to
 parametrization and is asymptotically equal to Bayesian cross-validation
 (Watanabe 2010). WAIC = -2 * (lppd - p_waic_2). Where lppd is the log pointwise
 predictive density and p_waic_2 is the estimated effective number of parameters
 based on the variance estimator from Vehtari et al. 2016. (p_waic_1 is the mean
 estimator).
