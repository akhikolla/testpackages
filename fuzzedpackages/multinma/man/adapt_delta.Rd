\title{Target average acceptance probability}
\description{
The Stan control argument \code{adapt_delta} sets the target average acceptance
probability for the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) used by Stan.
}
\details{
The default value of \code{adapt_delta} used by \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}} is 0.8 for fixed
effect models, and 0.95 for random effects models.

You should not need to change \code{adapt_delta} unless you see a warning
message about divergent transitions. Increasing \code{adapt_delta} from the
default to a value closer to 1 means that Stan will use a smaller step
size, making sampling slower but more robust, and resulting in fewer
divergent transitions.
