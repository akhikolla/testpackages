\title{Check network connectedness}
\usage{
is_network_connected(network)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{An \code{nma_data} object, as created by the functions \verb{set_*()} or
\code{combine_network()}.}
}
\value{
Logical \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}
}
\description{
Check whether a network is connected - whether there is a path of study
evidence linking every pair of treatments in the network.
}
\details{
Models will still run with disconnected networks. However, estimated
relative effects between treatments across disconnected parts of the
network will be entirely based on the prior distribution (typically very
uncertain), as there is no information to update the prior distribution.
Relative effects within each connected sub-network will be estimated as if
each sub-network had been analysed separately.
