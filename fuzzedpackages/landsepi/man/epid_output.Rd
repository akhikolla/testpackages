specifying the type of outputs to generate (see details):\itemize{

\item "gla_rel": Relative Green Leaf Area
\item "eco_product": Crop production
\item "eco_cost": Crop costs

\item "HLIR_dynamics", "H_dynamics", "L_dynamics", "IR_dynamics", "HLI_dynamics", etc.: Epidemic dynamics
related to the specified sanitary status (H, L, I or R and all their combinations).
Graphics only, works only if graphic=TRUE.
\item "all": compute all these outputs (default).
}}

\item{time_param}{list of simulation parameters:\itemize{
\item Nyears = number cropping seasons,
\item nTSpY = number of time-steps per cropping season.
}}

\item{Npatho}{number of pathogen genotypes.}

\item{area}{a vector containing polygon areas (must be in square meters).}

\item{rotation}{a dataframe containing for each field (rows) and year (columns, named "year_1", "year_2", etc.),
the index of the cultivated croptype. Importantly, the matrix must contain 1 more column than the real number
of simulated years.}

\item{croptypes}{a dataframe with three columns named 'croptypeID' for croptype index,
'cultivarID' for cultivar index and 'proportion' for the proportion of the cultivar within the croptype.}

\item{cultivars_param}{list of parameters associated with each host genotype (i.e. cultivars):
\itemize{
\item name = vector of cultivar names,
\item initial_density = vector of host densities (per square meter) at the beginning of the cropping season,
\item max_density = vector of maximum host densities (per square meter) at the end of the cropping season,
\item cultivars_genes_list = a list containing, for each host genotype, the indices of carried resistance genes.
}}

\item{eco_param}{a list of economic parameters for each host genotype as if cultivated in pure crop:\itemize{
\item yield_perHa = a dataframe of 4 columns for the yield associated with hosts in sanitary status H, L, I and R,
and one row per host genotype (yields are expressed in weight or volume units / ha / cropping season),
\item production_cost_perHa = a vector of overall production costs (in monetary units / ha / cropping season)
including planting costs, amortisation, labour etc.,
\item market_value = a vector of market values of the productions (in monetary units / weight or volume unit).
}}

\item{GLAnoDis}{the value of absolute GLA in absence of disease (required to compute economic outputs).}

\item{ylim_param}{a list of graphical parameters for each required output: bounds for y-axes for
audpc, gla_abs, gla_rel, eco_cost, eco_product, eco_benefit, eco_grossmargin.}

\item{writeTXT}{a logical indicating if the output is written in a text file (TRUE) or not (FALSE).}

\item{graphic}{a logical indicating if a tiff graphic of the output is generated (only if more than one year is simulated).}

\item{path}{path of text file (if writeTXT = TRUE) and tiff graphic (if graphic = TRUE) to be generated.}
}
\value{
A list containing, for each required type of output, a matrix summarising the output for each year and cultivar
(as well as the whole landscape).
Each matrix can be written in a txt file (if writeTXT=TRUE), and illustrated in a graphic (if graphic=TRUE).
}
\description{
Generates epidemiological and economic outputs from model simulations.
}
\details{
Outputs are computed every year for every cultivar as well as for the whole landscape. \describe{
\item{\strong{Epidemiological outputs.}}{
The epidemiological impact of pathogen spread can be evaluated by different measures: \enumerate{
\item Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC): average proportion of diseased hosts (status I + R)
relative to the carrying capacity (i.e. disease severity).
\item Absolute Green Leaf Area (GLAa): average number of healthy hosts (status H) per time step and per square meter.
\item Relative Green Leaf Area (GLAr): average proportion of healthy hosts (status H) relative to the total number
of existing hosts (H+L+I+R).
}
}
\item{\strong{Economic outputs.}}{
The economic outcome of a simulation can be evaluated using: \enumerate{
\item Crop production: yearly crop production (e.g. grains, fruits, wine) in weight (or volume) units
per hectare (depends on the number of productive hosts and associated yield).
\item Crop benefits: yearly benefits generated from product sales, in monetary units per hectare
(depends on crop production and market value of the product).
\item Crop costs: yearly costs associated with crop production (including planting, amortisation, labour, ...)
in monetary units per hectare (depends on initial host density and production cost).
\item Crop gross margin, i.e. benefits - costs, in monetary units per hectare.
