Description: Statistical hypothesis testing methods for
 inferring model-free functional dependency using asymptotic
 chi-squared or exact distributions. Functional test
 statistics are asymmetric and functionally optimal, unique
 from other related statistics. Tests in this package reveal
 evidence for causality based on the
 causality-by-functionality principle. They include
 asymptotic functional chi-squared tests
 (Zhang & Song 2013) <arXiv:1311.2707> and an exact
 functional test (Zhong & Song 2019)
 <doi:10.1109/TCBB.2018.2809743>. The normalized functional
 chi-squared test was used by Best Performer 'NMSUSongLab'
 in HPN-DREAM (DREAM8) Breast Cancer Network Inference
 Challenges (Hill et al 2016) <doi:10.1038/nmeth.3773>. A
 function index (Zhong & Song 2019)
 <doi:10.1186/s12920-019-0565-9> (Kumar et al 2018)
 <doi:10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621502> derived from the
 functional test statistic offers a new effect size measure
 for the strength of functional dependency, a better
 alternative to conditional entropy in many aspects. For
 continuous data, these tests offer an advantage over
 regression analysis when a parametric functional form
 cannot be assumed; for categorical data, they provide a
 novel means to assess directional dependency not possible
 with symmetrical Pearson's chi-squared or Fisher's exact
 tests.
