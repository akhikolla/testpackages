Title: Check Text Files Content at a Glance
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: c(
    person("David", "Gohel", role = c("aut", "cre"),
    email = "david.gohel@ardata.fr"))
Description: Tools to help text files importation. It can return 
 the number of lines; print the first and last lines; convert 
 encoding. Operations are made without reading the entire file 
 before starting, resulting in good performances with large files. 
 This package provides an alternative to a simple use of the 
 'head', 'tail', 'wc' and 'iconv' programs that are not always 
 available on machine where R is installed.
