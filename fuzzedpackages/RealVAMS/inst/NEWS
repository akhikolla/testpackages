Version 0.4-3: 2019-04-22
	- Added the joint covariance matrix, C, of the estimated fixed effects and
		predicted random effects to the output. See Henderson (1975).
	- Paper reference added to manuals and to CITATION file.

Version 0.4-0: 2017-08-13
        - New arguments added to the RealVAMS function
	-- independent.responses defaults to FALSE. If TRUE,
		this option will model the responses independently
		by fixing the covariances in G at 0 as well as the
		covariances in the last row/column of R. The resulting
		estimates are the same as those that would be obtained by
		modelling the test scores in package GPvam (with REML=FALSE)
		and modelling the binary respones in SAS GLIMMIX (RealVAMS
		has been validated against these programs).
	-- cpp.benchmark defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, this option will
		perform the calculations shown in equation (16) of Karl,
		Yang, Lohr (2013) using both R and the embedded C++ code
		to demonstrate the time savings of using C++. A summary 
		table is printed at the end.
	- The functions in the code of the file vp_cp (the estimation routine)
		have been commented to explain their purpose and to reference
		which equations from Karl, Yang, Lohr (2013) or Wolfinger and
		O'Connell (1993) they represent

Version 0.3-3: 2017-03-02
        - Add generic summary, plot, and print functions.
	- Added detail to documentation for the RealVAMS function
	- Reformatted user manual documentation for simulated data
	- Renamed some of the elements of the RealVAMS class

        - Minor updates to package structure to match new CRAN requirements.

Version 0.3-1: 2014-11-01
        - First public release.
