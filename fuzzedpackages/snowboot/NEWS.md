# snowboot 1.0.0

The latest update standardizes naming convention and fixes bugs. 

## Major Changes
Streamlined and simplified functions related to LSMI sampling, estimation, bootstrap, and overall cross-validation (not functions related to igraph, vertboot, or network construction).

Added an S3 method plot.snowboot for plotting results of LSMI sample estimation and bootstrap.
 
Changes to object names.
* Camel-case and "." convention replaced with lowercase and "_" between words.

Note that the version 1.0.0 is not backward-compatible.
