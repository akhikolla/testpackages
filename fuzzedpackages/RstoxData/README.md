## Introduction

RstoxData is a package to parse and manipulate various data formats for fisheries.

The package contains functions for reading, filtering and writing fisheries' trawl survey samples (biotic), acoustic trawl survey and commercial catch samples (landings) data in XML formats.

Loaded data can also be filtered by using any supported R conditional syntax such as `longitude > 10`, or by user pre-defined functions such as `inside()`.

### Supported formats:

#### A. Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR) ([data definitions](https://www.imr.no/formats/)):

  1. Biotic (fish trawl survey) XML format (up to version 3.1).
  2. Acoustic (acoustic/echosounder trawl surveys) XML format (version 1).
  3. Landings (commercial catch samples) XML format (version 2).

#### B. Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries:
  1. Sales Notes data in the LSS format.
  2. Electronic logbooks (ERS) in tabular format.

#### C. International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) ([data definitions](https://ices.dk/data/data-portals/Pages/acoustic.aspx)):

  1. Biotic (fish trawl survey) XML format.
  2. Acoustic (acoustic/echosounder trawl surveys) XML format.
