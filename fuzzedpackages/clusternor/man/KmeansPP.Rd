\title{Perform the k-means++ clustering algorithm on a data matrix.}
\usage{
KmeansPP(
  data,
  centers,
  nrow = -1,
  ncol = -1,
  nstart = 1,
  nthread = -1,
  dist.type = c("sqeucl", "eucl", "cos", "taxi")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data file name on disk (NUMA optimized) or In memory data matrix}

\item{centers}{The number of centers (i.e., k)}

\item{nrow}{The number of samples in the dataset}

\item{ncol}{The number of features in the dataset}

\item{nstart}{The number of iterations of kmeans++ to run}

\item{nthread}{The number of parallel threads to run}

\item{dist.type}{What dissimilarity metric to use c("taxi", "eucl", "cos")}
}
\value{
A list containing the attributes of the output.
 cluster: A vector of integers (from 1:\strong{k}) indicating the cluster to
         which each point is allocated.
 centers: A matrix of cluster centres.
 size: The number of points in each cluster.
 energy: The sum of distances for each sample from it's closest cluster.
 best.start: The sum of distances for each sample from it's closest cluster.
}

\examples{
iris.mat <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])
k <- length(unique(iris[, dim(iris)[2]])) # Number of unique classes
nstart <- 3
km <- KmeansPP(iris.mat, k, nstart=nstart)
