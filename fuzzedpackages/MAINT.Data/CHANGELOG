########## Version 2.5.0 (September 2020) ###################

Version 2.5.0 implements the following changes:

1)  All remaining MAINT.Data specific S3 methods and classes were converted into S4
    methods and classes.

2)  The MAINT.Data definition of several generic methods (ex: sd, BIC, AIC, logLik) already
    defined in other packages has beed droped, avoiding unecessary masking.

3)  A dim method was added to the IData class.

4)  THe dependency on the sn package was changed, so that MAINT.Data always calls se functions
    when necessary, and it no longer copies its code in the R directory

5)  Several new examples have been added to the manual, which was also corrected for some
    spelling mistakes.

########## Versions 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 (June 2020) ###################

Versions 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 implement the following changes:

1)  The linear algebra routines were changed so that the multicolinearity is now always checked
    beased on the l2-condition norm of correlation (instead of covariance) matrices, with
    an upper limit on numerical non-singular covariance matrix given by an argument (k2max, defaulting
    to 1e8) that may be changed by the user.

2) The IData class and AgrMcDt functions were modified in order to accept inputs from any class that
   inherits from data.frames.

3) The IData class was extended with the slot NbMicroUnits that gives the number of micro-data units
   aggregated (when applicable) in each statistical IData unit.   

4) The C++ linear algebra computations are now based on the RcppArmadillo package instead of being
   based on the RcppEigen package, as it was the case in previous versions.

########## Versions 2.2.0 throught 2.3.0 (May-August 2019) ###################

Versions 2.2.0 through 2.3.0 implement the following changes:

1)  The function AgrMcDt now prints an warning when degenerate interval were found in the microdata.

2)  New accessor methods were added to class IData, in order to acces data frames with the MidPoints, LogRanges and Ranges
    without having to look directly of the IData slots.

3)  A new class named IdtOutl was creasted, saving the information about the outliers found by the function  getIdtOutl into an S4 object.
    This classes has corresponding print, summary, plot and several accessor methods for better inspection and visualization of 
    its content.

4)  A new function named pcoordplot was added. This function plots paralel coordinate plots, helping the interpretation of
    a model based clustering analysis of interval-valued data.

5) The function DACrossVal now prints automatically its error rate estimates every time it is run.  

6) New accessor methods were added to class IdtMclust, in order to acces the results of a model based clustering analysis of 
   interval-valued data, without having to look directly of the IdtMclust slots.

7) A new function named MANOVAPermTest was added. This function implements a permutation test in order to find p-values
   of Interval-valued MANOVA analysis on small samples, where the asymptotic chi-square approximation is not reliable.


########## Versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 (April 2019) ###################

Versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 implement the following changes:

1) Improved plot methods and new extractors (e.g. colnames, rownames, MidPoints, LogRanges,
   Lbounds, Ubounds, for objects of class IData).

2) The value returned from function DACrossVal when argument LOO is set to FALSE now returns 
   N.A. (instead of 0.) for combinations of folders and classes where no observation was evaluated.
   Furthemore, when LOO is set to TRUE DACrossVal now returns by default a vector with the estimates 
   of the error rate by class, and not a three-dimensional array with a the individual results for
   each combination of observation and class (which can still be returned with LOO=TRUE, but now
   only if the argument fullresults is also set to TRUE).

########## Version 2.0.0 (September 2018) ###################

Version 2.0.0 implements the following major changes:

1) A new function (AgrMcDt) for the cretation of IData objectos from the agregation of microdata. 

2) The IData class was extended with plot, rbind and cbind methods. 

In additional several small bugs were corrected and algorithmic aspects of the implementation were improved.


########## Version 1.2.3 (August 2018) ###################

Version 1.2.3 fixes a small bug in the interface of getIdtOutl.
In previous versions the getIdtOutl argument IdtE was wrongly assumed to be a list instead
of an object of class IdtSngNDE (single distribution classical normal estimators) or IdtSngNDRE 
(single distribution robust normal estimators), as required.
This problem prevented getIdtOutl from automatically recovering the list of observations used 
in the re-weighted MCD estimator, from the RewghtdSet slot (when not NULL) of the IdtE argument, 
as originally intended.  
The problem was fixed in version 1.2.3

########## Version 1.2.2 (July 2018) ###################

Version 1.2.2 fixes a bug in function fasttle that occurred when this procedure was called with
argument getalpha="TwoStep‚Äù and in the first step no outlier was detected. In this situation
versions 1.2.1 and older failed to distinguish between objects of class IdtSngNDE (single
distribution classical normal estimators) and IdtSngNDRE (single distribution robust normal estimators).
The problem was fixed in version 1.2.2

########## Version 1.2.1 (January 2018) ###################

Version 1.2.1 fixes a bug in function getIdtOutl

########## Version 1.2.0 (November 2017) ###################

The following changes were made in version 1.2.0 of R package MAINT.Data:

1) A new IData method, Idtmclust, implements model-based clustering of Iinterval Data
   based on Gaussian mixtures.  

2) A bug introduced in version 1.1.4 for the fasttle and fulltle methods was corrected

3) The show method for objects of class IdtMANOVA (and classes derived from IdtMANOVA) was improved

########## Version 1.1.4 (October 2017) ###################

The following changes were made in version 1.1.4 of R package MAINT.Data:

1)   The IdtSngNDRE and IdtMxNDRE classes were expanded in order to include slots 
     with the Robust Mahalanobis distances, the trimmed subsests, and other important
     information used in the robust estimation. We note that in previous versions this
     information was provided in a list, but only when otpType argument was not at its
     (now decrepated) default of "OnlyEst".

2)   The file Makevars was changed in order to make it compatible with the MAC osx-x86 Operating systems.

3)   Some minor bugs from previous versions were fixed. 

########## Version 1.1.3 (October 2017) ###################

Version 1.1.3 adds a Makevars file (in order to compress the C code library),
three new example data sets (LoansbyRskLvs_mimmaxDt, LoansbyRskLvs_qntlDt and 
LoansbyPurpose_mimmaxDt) and fixes some minor bugs from previous versions. 

########## Version 1.1.2 (June 2017) ###################

Version 1.1.2 updates and improves the documentation of MAINT.Data,
and corrects a previously unnoticed bug on the C code of function fullte. 


########## Versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 (June 2017) ###################

The following changes were made in versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 of R package MAINT.Data:


1)  The routines for robust estimation and outlier detection were improved and
    made more flexible. In particular, Version 1.1.o implements a novel enhanced
    method for finding bias correction factors for the re-weighted MCD estimator,
    and adds the function getIdtOutl, that tries to indentify outliers comparing
    robust Mahalanobis distances with quantiles either from asymptotic chi-square 
    distribtuions, or from F and Beta approximations that, according to the literature
    may work better in finite samples.   

2)  The methods rownames and colnames were added to the class IData, and methods
    var, cor (returning respectivelly matrices of variance-covariance and correlation
    estimates) were added to all classes derived from the class IdtE.

########## Versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 (October 2016) ###################

This is a major upgrade of the package with several new features and improvements of
the existing code. The two main extensions of version 1.0.0 are:

1)  The implementation of methods for estimation, testing and discriminant analysis based on the Skew-Normal
    distribution. For details see the documentation of the mle, MANOVA and snda methods and the IDtSNDE, IDtNandSNDE,
    IDtSngSNDE, IDtSngNandSNDE, IDtMxSNDE, IDtMxNandSNDE, IdtSNlocda, IdtLocSNMANOVA, IdtLocNSNMANOVA, 
    IdtGenSNMANOVA and IdtGenNSNMANOVA classes.

2)  The implementation of methods for the robust estimation of parameters of the guassian distribution, as well
    as the corresponding methods for robust linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. For details see the 
    documentation of fasttle, fulltle, Roblda and Robqda methods and the IDtSngNDRE and IDtMxNRDE classes.  

Furthermore, among other new features, version 1.0.0 also includes specializations of the generic vcov method
(returning estimates of the variance-covariance matrices for the parameter estimators used) for almost all 
(all except those based on robust methods) classes derived from IdtE, i.e. the classes containing results 
of model estimation.  


########## Versions 0.5 and 0.5.1 (October 2015) ###################

The following changes were made in Versions 0.5 and 0.5.1 of R package MAINT.Data:

1)  Several functions from the default package ""stats"" were imported 
    into the MAINT.Data namespace to ensure that they did not become undefined globals. 

2)  The strict dependecy on packages MASS and miscTools was restored by an Imports directive
    in the DESCRIPTION file (ensuring that these packages are always attached when installed)


##########  Version 0.4  (May 2015) #################

The strict dependecy on packages MASS and miscTools was replaced by a Suggests directive


##########  Version 0.3  (October 2014) #################

The following changes were made in Version 0.3 of R package MAINT.Data:

1) In the DESCRIPTION file the Depends directive for imported packages was repalced by an Imports directive

2) Lines with more 100 characters in the documentation files were split into two

3) The longer examples in the documentation files were replace by faster examples   


##########  Version 0.2  (October 2011) #################

The following changes were made in Version 0.2 of R package MAINT.Data:

1) The deprecated direct use of sd for data.frames was replaced by sapply(object,sd).

2) The original functions head, tail, coef, predict, stdEr, lda and qda
   were imported in order to properly recognizing them in the definition
   of methods for MAINT.Data classes.

3) the S3 method print for class summaryIData, and the S3 methods "[", "[<-" "=="
   and "!=" for class IData, were registered.

4) The function is.IData was replaced by is(object,"IData")
