Description: Structure learning of Bayesian network using coordinate-descent
    algorithm. This algorithm is designed for discrete network assuming a multinomial data set,
    and we use a multi-logit model to do the regression.
    The algorithm is described in Gu, Fu and Zhou (2016) <arXiv:1403.2310>.
