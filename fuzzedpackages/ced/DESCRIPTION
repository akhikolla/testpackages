Title: The Compact Encoding Detector
Description: R bindings of the Google Compact Encoding Detection library
  (<https://github.com/google/compact_enc_det>). The library takes as input
  a source buffer of raw text bytes and probabilistically determines the
  most likely encoding for that text. It was designed with accuracy,
  robustness, small size, and speed in mind.
Version: 1.0.1
