		entire tree creation algorithm (previously C + R)
		and prediction

* ADD:	summary statistics of tree
* ADD:	Access to nodes in the tree
* ADD:	data set (carEvaluation)

* ADD:	Roxygen2 annotation
* CHG:	Tests adapted to match new structure

2014-12-02

* FIX:	error in unused fucntion in utils.h
* CHG:	entropy calculation with log to basis 2
* CHG	refactoring of entropy calculation for ...
* CHG:	'minbucket' >= 0 allowed


2013-02-13
* VERS: 0.4.1
* CHG:	values for 'maxT' accepted in [-1,1]
* CHG:	renaming bare entropy methods to entropyIDM
		for better matching with NPI ones


2013-01-25
* VERS: 0.4.0 (private)
* CHG:	calcT() returns T-3 for interval dominance


2013-01-15
* VERS:	0.3.6 (private)
* FIX:	Previous bug fix lead to non convergence in
		minEntropyNPIa()
* ADD:	dominance criterion in call for tree generation
		to evaluate on training data directly


2013-01-14
* VERS:	0.3.5
* FIX:	Bug in in minEntropyNPIa(): Segfault on x86_64 
		architectures because of different precision
* FIX:	passing 'maxEntropyMethod' as method.param 
		if method is 'NPI'
* ADD:	Testing of C routines


2013-01-08
* VERS:	0.3.4 (private)
* FIX:	Bugs in minEntropyNPIa(): Segfault+infinte loop
* CHG:	improvement of C routine fcmp() for a more 
		reasonable double comparison
* CHG:	more consistent handling when passing arguments 
		to the function imptree_control()


2012-12-20
* VERS: 0.3.3 (private)
* FIX:	Unnecessary warnings
* CHG:	Clean-up of C code; removed unused parts


2012-12-18
* VERS: 0.3.2 (private)
* CHG:	further reduction of size of examples


2012-12-14
* VERS:	0.3.1 (private)
* FIX:	adjusted documentation that NPI is available
* CHG:	reduced size of examples, in terms of verbose 
		output and computing time


2012-12-14
* VERS:	0.3.0 (private)
* ADD:	inclusion of NPI as estimation method for class 
		probabilities


2012-11-27
* VERS:	0.2.1 (private)
* FIX:	bug in C function for calculating the entropy:
		recursion made it unable to run more than once 
		on Windows


2012-11-26
* VERS:	0.2.0 (private)
* ADD:	more verbose documentation
* ADD:	documentation for function predclass()
* CHG:	prediction and entropy calculation rewritten 
		in (much) faster C routines
* CHG:	structrue of code to allow for NPI
* CHG:	prediction on training data is no longer 
		carried out immediately after tree creation
* CHG:	accuracy() calls predict() internally and 
		accepts all arguments for customisation of 
		prediction 


2012-11-06
* VERS:	0.1.1 (private)
* FIX:	missing documentation added


2012-11-01 
* VERS:	0.1.0 (private)
* INIT:	initial functions for creating ad evaluating 
		IDM-based imprecise classification trees
