Title: Assessing the Partial Association Between Ordinal Variables
Description: An implementation of the unified framework for assessing partial 
    association between ordinal variables after adjusting a set of covariates
    (Dungang Liu, Shaobo Li, Yan Yu and Irini Moustaki (2020). Accepted by JASA). 
    This package provides a set of tools to quantify partial association, conduct 
    hypothesis testing for partial association, visualize partial regression models,
    and diagnose the specifications of each fitted model. This framework is
    based on the surrogate approach described in Liu and Zhang (2017) (<doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1292915>).
