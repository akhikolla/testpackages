Changes in ccaPP version 0.3.3

    + C++ functions properly registered.


Changes in ccaPP version 0.3.2

    + Added references for maxCorGrid() and permTest().

    + Added vignette 'ccaPP-intro'.


Changes in ccaPP version 0.3.1

    + Added 'diabetes' data from Andrews & Herzberg (1985).

    + Print method and help file of permutation tests no longer use the term
      'independence'.

    + Functions for robust CCA now standardize dummy variables with mean and
      standard deviation.

    + Bugfix in functions for CCA: R session no longer crashes for higher-order
      canonical correlations in case of high-dimensional data.


Changes in ccaPP version 0.3.0

    + Standardization in functions for CCA and maximum correlation is now
      optional.

    + Functions for CCA and maximum correlation now return center and scale
      estimates from standardization.

    + Slightly faster version of fastMedian().

    + Function permTest() now allows to supply permutations as an argument.

    + Bugfix in functions for CCA concerning side constraints for higher-order
      canonical correlations.

    + Bugfix in functions for CCA: reduced data for higher-order canonical
      correlations no longer standardized.

    + Bugfix in corM(): robust starting values now work with dummy variables.

    + Renamed internal C++ function rank() to fix error with clang++ under
      OS X Mavericks.



Changes in ccaPP version 0.2.0

    + Functions ccaGrid() and ccaProj() now force consistency of the Spearman,
      Kendall and quadrant correlation.

    + New functions maxCorGrid() and maxCorProj() for maximum correlation,
      which retain the argument for consistency of the Spearman, Kendall and
      quadrant correlation.

    + permTest(): now using the new functions maxCorGrid() and maxCorProj()
      rather than ccaGrid() and ccaProj().

    + permTest(): argument 'cl' is now preferred over argument 'ncores' for
      parallel computing.

    + Added fallback mode for robust standardization if the MAD of a variable
      is zero.

    + Bugfix in ccaGrid() and its wrapper CCAgrid: seed for the random number
      generator is no longer ignored.

    + Bugfix in CCAproj(): now correctly wrapped around ccaProj().



Changes in ccaPP version 0.1.1

    + Using package parallel now to detect the number of available processor
      cores rather than OpenMP.

    + Internally created parallel cluster in permTest() is now stopped via
      on.exit().

    + Bugfix in permTest(): random number streams for parallel clusters
      supplied by the user are only reset if a seed is supplied.
