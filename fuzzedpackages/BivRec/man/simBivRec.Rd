\title{Bivariate Alternating Recurrent Event Response and Covariate Data Simulation}
\usage{
simBivRec(nsize, beta1, beta2, tau_c, set)
}
\arguments{
\item{nsize}{Sample size which refers to the number of subjects in the data set where each subject could have multiple episodes of events.}

\item{beta1}{True coefficients for Type I gap times in the accelerated failure time model (AFT).}

\item{beta2}{True coefficients for Type II gap times in the accelerated failure time model (AFT).}

\item{tau_c}{Maximum support of censoring time. It can take values as follows:
\itemize{
\item \verb{tau_c=63} (default): corresponds to a 15\% censoring rate for each scenario in Tables 1 and 2 of Lee, Huang, Xu, Luo (2018).
\item \verb{tau_c=30}: corresponds to a 30\% censoring rate for each scenario in Tables 1 and 2 of Lee, Huang, Xu, Luo (2018).
}}

\item{set}{Simulation setting based on scenarios outlined in Tables 1 and 2 in Lee, Huang, Xu, Luo (2018). Choose 1.1 (default) for scenario 1 with \eqn{\rho=1} in the covariance matrix of the frailty vector, 1.2 for scenario 1 with \eqn{\rho=0.5}, 1.3 for scenario 1 with \eqn{\rho=0} and 2.0 for scenario 2.}
}
\value{
Data frame with the alternating recurrent event data and one continuous and one binary covariate.
}
\description{
This function simulates a series of alternating recurrent events based on the simulation setting in Lee, Huang, Xu, Luo (2018).
