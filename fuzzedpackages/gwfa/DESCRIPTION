Description: Performs Geographically Weighted Fractal Analysis (GWFA) to calculate the local fractal dimension of a set of points. GWFA mixes the Sandbox multifractal algorithm and the Geographically Weighted Regression. Unlike fractal box-counting algorithm, the sandbox algorithm avoids border effects because the boxes are adjusted on the set of points. The Geographically Weighted approach consists in applying a kernel that describes the way the neighbourhood of each estimated point is taken into account to estimate its fractal dimension. GWFA can be used to discriminate built patterns of a city, a region, or a whole country.
