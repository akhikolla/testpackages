  <TITLE>CARBIDE &lt;UK&gt; LOOKS TO ACQUISITIONS FOR GROWTH</TITLE>
  <DATELINE>NEW YORK, March 2 -</DATELINE>
  <BODY>Union Carbide Corp is looking to
acquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and
plastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president of
Chemicals and Plastics.
    Describing this as a major departure in the company&apos;s
approach to commercial development, he told the annual new
business forum of the Commercial Development Association &quot;We
are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look
like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth
markets we&apos;ve identified.&quot;
    Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude &quot;that if
we couldn&apos;t do it ourselves, it wasn&apos;t worth doing. Or, if it
was worth doing, we had to go it alone,&quot; Lichtenberger
explained.
    He said &quot;there are times when exploiting a profitable
market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to
plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link
up profitably with someone who is already there.&quot;
    He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way
and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the
same way.
