  <TITLE>KUWAIT MINISTER SAYS NO EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS SET</TITLE>
  <DATELINE>KUWAIT, March 2 -</DATELINE>
  <BODY>Kuwait&apos;s oil minister said in a newspaper
interview that there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
meeting after the recent weakness in world oil prices.
    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
daily al-Qabas as saying that &quot;none of the OPEC members has
asked for such a meeting.&quot;
    He also denied that Kuwait was pumping above its OPEC quota
of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd).
    Crude oil prices fell sharply last week as international
oil traders and analysts estimated the 13-nation OPEC was
pumping up to one million bpd over its self-imposed limits.
