Description: Optimal partitioning algorithm for change-in-slope problem with continuity constraint and a finite number of states. Some constraints can be enforced in the inference: isotonic, unimodal or smoothing. With the function slopeSN() (segment neighborhood) the number of segments to infer is fixed by the user and does not depend on a penalty value.
