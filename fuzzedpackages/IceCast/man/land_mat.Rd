\format{304 x 448 matix}
\usage{
land_mat
}
\description{
Binary matrix of dimension 304 x 448 with value for 1 for land grid boxes and
0 otherwise. Data are on a north Polar Stereographic grid with the land mask
simplified to match model output from the CM2.5 Forecast-oriented Low-Ocean
Resolution (FLOR) model produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administrationâ€™s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory converted to a Polar
Stereographic grid (Vecchi et al. 2014; Msadek et al. 2014).
Weights for converting to a polar stereograhic grid were obtained
from the spherical coordinate remapping and interpolation package
(SCRIP) (Jones 1997).
