Description: Provides a model designed to be a reliable testbed where various gene 
    drive interventions for mosquito-borne diseases control. It is being developed to 
    accommodate the use of various mosquito-specific gene drive systems within a 
    population dynamics framework that allows migration of individuals between patches 
    in landscape. Previous work developing the population dynamics can be found in Deredec et al. 
    (2001) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1110717108> and Hancock & Godfray (2007) <doi:10.1186/1475-2875-6-98>, 
    and extensions to accommodate CRISPR homing dynamics in Marshall et al. (2017) 
    <doi:10.1038/s41598-017-02744-7>.
