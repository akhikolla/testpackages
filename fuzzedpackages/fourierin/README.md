# fourierin
Guillermo Basulto-Elias  

This is a package in `R` to numerically calculate Fourier-type integrals of univariate and bivariate  functions with compact support and simultaneously evaluated at several points. If the evaluation grid is equally spaced, a Fast Fourier Transform method is used to speed up computations.
