ecp 3.1.3
============
Changes made since previous version

* Corrected references.

ecp 3.1.2
============
Changes made since previous version

* Updated compatibility with C++11.
* Fixed bug where type int caused incorrect truncation of double values.

ecp 3.1.1
============
Changes made since previous version

* Added function kcpa for kernel change point analysis.

ecp 3.1.0
============
Changes made since previous version

* Fixed bugs and updated pruning step.

ecp 3.0.0
============
Changes made since previous version

* Added a new function ks.cp3o. This is a new way to perform change point analysis.
  It uses dynamic programming and pruning in order to obtain change point estimates. It uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic as goodness-of-fit measure.

ecp 2.0.0
============
Changes made since previous version

* Added a new function e.cp3o. This is a new way to perform change point analysis.
  It uses dynamic programming and pruning in order to obtain change point estimates. It uses the E-statistic as goodness-of-fit measure.

ecp 1.6.2
============
Changes made since previous version

* Updated citation information and added vignette.

ecp 1.6.1
============
Changes made since previous version

* Changed name of list element returned by e.agglo. Instead of opt it is now estimates. 
This is so that its behaviour more closely resembles that of e.divisive.

ecp 1.6.0
============
Changes made since previous version

* Removed the potential for the permutation test to terminate early.
This was causing memory issues, and will be brought back once these
issues have been resolved.

ecp 1.5.6
============
Changes made since previous version

* Fixed issue with examples taking too long to run when installing package.

ecp 1.5.5
============
Change made since previous version

* The DJIA dataset now includes the univariate  market index, as well as the multivariate time series created by the DOW30 companies. Kraft is not included in the multivariate series.

* The list elements in the DJIA dataset are now named; "date", "index", and "market". The "index" component used to be named "returns". The "market" component contains the multivariate time series.

ecp 1.5.4
============
Changes made since previous version

* Some of the components of the list returned by both methods have been renamed.

* The member argument for e.agglo now has a default value.

* Fixed issue with the e.agglo penalty argument.

* The penalty argument for e.agglo now accepts a function that depends only on the change point locations.

* Both the e.agglo and e.divisive methods now also return the estimated membership vector.

* The e.divisive method now also returns a vector containing the number of permutations performed at each stage of the sequential testing procedure.

* The STPP dataset has been removed from the package.

ecp 1.5.3
============
Changes made since previous version

* The agglomerative procedure now includes an argument for a penalty term.

* New permutation test implementation. The new version is based on the method of Gandy (2009), and R 
now is the maximum number of permutations to perform.

* Added 2 additional arguments to the e.divisive() method. These arguments are necessary to implement the 
updated permutation test.

* Function argument names now adhere to standard R naming conventions.

* Names of returned list components now adhere to standard R naming convention.

* In the list returned by the e.divisive() method, the list component has been renamed estimates.

* Updated documentation.

ecp 1.5.2
============
Changes made since previous version

* Reordered the argument list for the e.agglo() method. The call is now e.agglo(data, member, alpha=1).

* In the list returned by the e.agglo() method, the gof component
  has been renamed fit.
