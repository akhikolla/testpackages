This is the initial public version of rDotNet.  This version has been successfully built and tested on:

- Windows 10 Pro
- Ubuntu Linux 14.04

# rDotNet 0.9.1
This version fixes some build issues.

- Jari Karppinen noted that the build for linux was broken so submitted some patches.
- added unit tests to the tests directory (which will be skipped if .NET is not available)
- adjusted the TcpClient source to use a newer API, so will build on Solaris
