# rDotNet
rDotNet allows R to access .NET libraries, with the .NET library running either locally or on a remote machine. From R one can:

- create .NET objects
- call member functions
- call class functions (i.e. static members)
- access and set properties
- access indexing members

The codebase includes .NET code for the CLR server, as well as a
python extension.   The codebase can be found at:

- [.NET Bridge](https://github.com/tr8dr/.Net-Bridge/tree/master) (.NET interop for R and Python)

The following data types in arguments are supported:

- .NET objects
- integers (16, 32, 64) bit
- floats (32, 64) bit
- strings
- byte
- enums
- boolean
- arrays of: objects, integers, doubles, boolean, bytes, strings, etc
- vectors (with optional named index)
- matrices (with optional named row and column indices)

## How It Works
The R or Python packages communicate with the .NET side through simple client / server interactions.  Your .NET libraries are loaded by a runner ```CLRServer.exe``` that provides a TCP-based API, giving full visibility into your library(ies). 

On first use from R or Python, the package will start the .NET bridge server (or alternatively connect to an existing server).  If the server is started from within VisualStudio, Xamarin Studio, or other tool, can be run in debug mode, so that you can debug your libraries as they are called from R or Python.

When a method is first called the code looks for all methods in a class that may match based on name and number of arguments and then picks the method from that subset with the closest convertible signature.  The argument set need not be a perfect match in terms of types provided that the types can be reasonably converted.   For example strings will be converted to enum values if a given signature requires an enum, integers can be converted to floating point, double[] arrays can be applied to double[] or Vector<double>, etc.  These signatures are cached so that subsequent calls avoid scanning.

For example if a class has 2 overloaded public methods "F":

- ```public double F (double x, Vector<double> series)```
- ```public double F (Direction dir, Vector<double> series)```

where Direction is ```enum Direction { Up, Down }```.  If the object is called from R or python as:

```R
vec <- c(0.1, 0.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2)
obj$F ('Up', vec)
```
the second method would be chosen given that 'Up' is convertible to ```Direction.Up``` and the numeric array is convertible to ```Vector<double>```.

## Initialization
The .NET bridge server (CLRServer.exe) will not have access to your code unless you indicate a DLL to be loaded.  One needs to instruct the server to load a dll or dlls from your environment.  There are a number of ways to do this:

- run CLRServer.exe -dll <path to your dll> on the command line 
- run CLRServer.exe -dll <path to your dll> in your favorite IDE (particularly useful for debugging)
- run from within R or Python

From within R one has two options.  The first approach is to set an environment variable either within the R session or externally:
```R
## set environment variable
Sys.setenv(rDotNet_DLL="~/Dev/mymodels.dll") OR
Sys.setenv(RDOTNET_DLL="~/Dev/mymodels.dll")

## load package
require(rDotNet)

## create an object and call a method
obj <- .cnew ("NormalDistribution1D", 0.0, 1.0)
obj$F (0.1)
```

The second approch is to explicitly call the rDotNet initialization function:
```R
require(rDotNet)

## initialize
.cinit(dll="~/Dev/mymodels.dll")

## create an object and call a method
obj <- .cnew ("NormalDistribution1D", 0.0, 1.0)
obj$F (0.1)
```


## Example
Assuming the following (contrived) .NET classes:
```C#
namespace com.stg.dummy 
{
    class Point (double X, double Y);
    
    class Circle
    {
        Circle (double radius)
        {
            _radius = radius;
        }

        public double Radius 
            { get { return _radius; } set { _radius = value; } }
        public double Area 
            { get { return Math.PI * _radius * _radius; } }
            
        ...
            
        // function returning list of objects
        public List<Point> PointsFor1 (int npoints)
        {
            var incr = 2.0 * Math.PI / (double)npoints;
            var list = new List<Point>[);
            
            for (int i = 0 ; i < npoints ; i++)
            {
                var theta = (double)i * incr;
                var x = _radius * Math.cos(theta);
                var y = _radius * Math.sin(theta);
                list.Add (new Point(x,y));
            }
            
            return list;
        }
        
        // function returning array of objects
        public Point[] PointsFor2 (int npoints)
        {
            return PointsFor(npoints).ToArray();
        }        
    }
}

```
The R api uses the $ syntax to reference members much like other R object approaches.  Here is how we could call the above from R:
```R
## create circle object
circle <- .cnew("com.stg.dummy.Circle", 10.0)

## get the list of points back
pointlist <- circle$PointsFor1 (100)

## dereference one of the point objects
point <- pointlist[2]

## or do it all in one go
point <- circle$PointsFor1 (100)[3]

## getting a property
circle$Get("Area")

## setting a property
circle$Set("Radius, 20)

```

# Installation
In general one installs this package like any other R package.
However .NET should be present on the machine and in the path.  See
the OS specific installation instructions below.

## Unix
Depending on how your system is setup, the above may require running
as sudo on unix.  One should also make sure you have the mono SDK installed
and **nuget** and **msbuild** or **xbuild** in your path.   On OS X mono installs in:

- /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Commands

and on Linux will depend on the package installer.  The  bin directory
where msbuild / xbuild and nuget reside must be added to your path.
Note that on windows and OS X, the builder is called 'msbuild' and on
linux is 'xbuild'.  Before
running the package install, check that **nuget** and **msbuild** / **xbuild**
can be run from the command line, then run the following:

```sh
R CMD INSTALL rDotNet
```


## Windows
Windows will have .NET installed by default.  However the various executables
needed for building may not be in your path.  Adjust your path so that
 **msbuild** and associated compilers are visible (you can adjust
 **Path** settings in the control panel).  The path to the various
 tools may be in the following directory or something similar:

- c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319

If you do not have a command line version of nuget installed, you will need to install nuget
and place in your path.  Can find a command line version of nuget here:

- https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe

On windows you will also need to install the **Rtools** toolset for building R packages, available
on CRAN.  Finally with all of the above installed and working, can run the installation as
follows:

```sh
R CMD INSTALL rDotNet
```
