# ideq
### An R package for Dynamic Spatio-temporal Models (DSTMs)

ideq fits two main categories of Bayesian DSTMs: 
empirical orthogonal function (EOF) models
and integrodifference equation (IDE) models, the package's namesake.
The EOF models use an observation matrix derived from the principal components of the data
while the IDE models are based on diffusion dynamics and involve redistribution kernel&mdash;a
probability distribution governing diffusion from one time point to the next.
