\value{
A \code{list} object containing the elements:

      the data for the conservation projects. It contains the following

          is the number of features, indicating the enhanced probability that
          each feature will persist if it funded. Missing values (\code{NA})
          indicate that a feature does not benefit from a project being
          funded.}

          the number of actions (equal to the number of features in this
          simulated data), indicating if an action is associated with a
          project (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).}

         column indicating if a project is associated with the baseline

      \describe{

       \item{\code{"name"}}{\code{character} name for each feature.}

        \item{\code{"weight"}}{\code{numeric} weight for each feature.
          For each feature, this is calculated as the amount of time that
          elapsed between the present and the features' last common ancestor.

          of evolutionary history that each feature has experienced.}

\description{
Simulate data for developing project prioritizations. Here, data are
simulated such that each feature has its own conservation project,
similar to species-based prioritizations (e.g. Bennett \emph{et al.} 2014).
}
\details{
The simulated data set will contain one conservation project for
  each features, and also a "baseline" (do nothing) project to reflect
  features' persistence when their conservation project is not
  funded. Each conservation project is associated with a single action, and
  no conservation projects share any actions. Specifically, the data are
  simulated as follows:

  \enumerate{

    \item A conservation project is created for each feature, and each
      project is associated with its own single action.

    \item Cost data for each action are simulated using a normal
      distribution and the \code{cost_mean} and \code{cost_sd} arguments.

    \item A set proportion of the actions are randomly set to be locked
      in and out of the solutions using the \code{locked_in_proportion} and
      \code{locked_out_proportion} arguments.

    \item The probability of each project succeeding if its action is funded
      is simulated by drawing probabilities from a uniform distribution with
      the upper and lower bounds set as the \code{success_min_probability}
      and \code{success_max_probability} arguments.

    \item The probability of each feature persisting if its project is funded
      and is successful is simulated by drawing probabilities from a uniform
      distribution with the upper and lower bounds set as the
      \code{funded_min_persistence_probability} and
      \code{funded_max_persistence_probability} arguments.

    \item An additional project is created which represents the "baseline"
      (do nothing) scenario. The probability of each feature persisting
      when managed under this project is simulated by drawing probabilities
      from a uniform distribution with the upper and lower bounds
      set as the \code{baseline_min_persistence_probability}
      and \code{baseline_max_persistence_probability} arguments.

    \item A phylogenetic tree is simulated for the features using
      \code{\link[ape]{rcoal}}.

    \item Feature data are created from the phylogenetic tree. The
      weights are calculated as the amount of evolutionary history
      that has elapsed between each feature and its last common ancestor.
