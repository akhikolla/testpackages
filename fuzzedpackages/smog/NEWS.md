# smog 2.1.0

* Use pkgdown to build a package website. 
* Added cv.cglasso, plot.cv.cglasso functions for applying a condictional group lasso method to selet biomarkers. 
* Added plot.cv.smog function to visualize model selection process by tuning penalty parameters.

# smog 2.0

* First version published in [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=smog).


# smog 1.0 

* **smog 1.0** is an initial version that contains the work on constrained structural modeling by using overlapped group penalties since June, 2018.

* This version aims to fit a generalized linear model for the cases of small n, large p data, conditioning on the expertise knowledge by non-penalizing some phenotype covariate variables, and penalizing the groups of prognostic and predictive effects by using overlapped L2 and L1 penalties.
