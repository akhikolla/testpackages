Description: Fits a linear non-penalized phenotype (demographic) variables 
    and penalized groups of prognostic effect and predictive effect, by satisfying such
    hierarchy structures that if a predictive effect exists, its prognostic effect must 
    also exist. This package can deal with continuous, binomial or multinomial, and survival
    response variables, underlying the assumption of Gaussian, binomial (multinomial), and 
    Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. It is implemented by combining the iterative
    shrinkage-thresholding algorithm and the alternating direction method of multipliers
    algorithms. The main method is built in C++, and the complementary methods are
    written in R.
