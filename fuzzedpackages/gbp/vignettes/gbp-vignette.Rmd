# Overview

Basic infrastructure and several algorithms for __1d - 4d bin packing problem__. This package provides a set of __c-level classes and solvers for 1d - 4d bin packing problem__, and __an r-level solver for 4d bin packing problem__, which is a wrapper over the c-level 4d bin packing problem solver. 

The 4d bin packing problem solver aims to solve bin packing problem, a.k.a container loading problem, with an additional constraint on weight. Given a set of rectangular-shaped items, and a set of rectangular-shaped bins with weight limit, the solver looks for an orthogonal packing solution such that minimizes the number of bins and maximize volume utilization. Each rectangular-shaped item i = 1, .. , n is characterized by length l\_i, depth d\_i, height h\_i, and weight w\_i, and each rectangular-shaped bin j = 1, .. , m is specified similarly by length l\_j, depth d\_j, height h\_j, and weight limit w\_j. The item can be rotated into any orthogonal direction, and no further restrictions implied.

Imagine yourself as a store manager, and your customers are placing orders on your inventory catalog. The orders should be specified in a __data.table__, where each order is uniquely identified by the __order id (oid)__, and each order includes one or more products which each uniquely identified by __stock keeping unit (sku)__ with specific __length (l), depth (d), height (h)__ and __weight (w)__. The orders are expected to be packed into one or more boxes, a.k.a, bins. The available bin types are specified in a __data.table__, where each type of bin is uniquely indentified by a __bin id (id)__ with specific __length (l), depth (d), height (h)__ and __weight limit (w)__. The objective is __packing each order into the smallest number of bins, and then smallest bins to achieve highest utlization rate, subject to the three dimensional none overlap contraints and weight limit constraint__.

# __gbp__ package design

## R-level class, solver and viewer

### solver

The function __gbp::bpp_solver(it, bn)__ aims to pack each order into the smallest number of bins, and then smallest bins to achieve highest utlization rate, subject to the three dimensional none overlap contraints and weight limit constraint.

```{r}
#- bpp_solver: output: packing solution

#- sn
#  sn bpp_solution packing solution <list>
#  - it item <data.table>
#    - oid: order id <integer>
#    - sku: stock keeping unit as it id <character>
#    - tid: ticket id - an unique id within oid <integer>
#    - otid: order id x ticket id - an unique indentifier indicate it with same tid can be packed into one bin <character>
#    - bid: bn id <integer>
#    - x, y, z it position in bid bin <numeric>
#    - l, d, h it scale along x, y, z <numeric>
#    - w it weight <numeric>
#  - bn bins <data.table>
#    - id bn id <character>
#    - l bn length limit along x-coordinate <numeric>
#    - d bn depth  limit along y-coordinate <numeric>
#    - h bn height limit along z-coordinate <numeric>
#    - w bn weight limit along w - a separate single dimension <numeric>
sn <- gbp::bpp_solver(it = it, bn = bn)

sn$it

sn$bn

```

The packing solution is revealed in the __data.table sn[["it"]]__. The packing solution table includes 12 columns: the __order id (oid)__, the __stock keeping unit (sku)__, the __ticket id (tid)__ which identify items should be packed into the same bin, the __order ticket id (otid)__ which is a unique identifier accross all orders, the __bin id (bid)__ which identify the bin type associated with the ticket, the coordinates within the bin __x, y, z__, and the item's __length (l), depth (d), height (h)__ and __weight (w)__. The solution can be viewed using __gbp::bpp_viewer(sn)__. 
 
### viewer

```{r}
#- bpp_viewer: a packing solution viewer
#   requires rgl, run in r-console will create interactive 3d views in rgl window
# bpp_viewer(sn)
```

The function __bpp_solver__ is fast. I applied a simpler version of __bpp_solver__ when designing and optimizing the set of boxes used in Jet.com's warehouses. Back then, Jet.com receives 15,000 - 20,000 orders everyday, and 1 - 100 items in each order. The __bpp_solver__ can pack all orders in 2 minutes - 5 minutes. The solution quality is also high. We formulated a mixed integer linear programming algorithm to find global optimial solution, using the __bpp_solver__ solution as initial search point. We observed that __bpp_solver__ solution is often equivalent or very close to the global optimial solution - often within 1% - 2% of utilization rate difference. One particular case to note is that the utilization rate difference could be as high as 4% - 5% when __bpp_solver__ solution requires exact 2 bins. This is a consequence of the greedy algorithm. At last, the __bpp_solver__ is __300x__ faster than the mixed integer linear programming.

## C-level class, solver and viewer

The design flow of c-level classes, solvers and viewers are straightforward. The __gbp1d__, __gbp2d__, __gbp3d__, and __gbp4d__ are classes defined at each dimension, an instance of such class holds a feasible bin packing solution in corresponding dimension. The __gbp1d_solver_dpp__, __gbp2d_solver_dpp__, __gbp3d_solver_dpp__, and __gbp4d_solver_dpp__ are solvers designed to solve corresponding problem, and return an instance of corresponding class. The __gbp2d_checkr__, __gbp3d_checkr__, and __gbp4d_checkr__ are checkers designed to verify a solution is feasible. And, the __gbp2d_viewer__, __gbp3d_viewer__, and __gbp4d_viewer__ are viewers designed to visualize a solution.

### gbp4d

The 4d scenairo contains two classes __gbp4d__ and __gbp4q__, and two solvers __gbp4d_solver_dpp__ and __gbp4d_solver_dpp_filt__. 

The two solvers implement an extreme point based best fit first recursive algorithm. At each step an item is fit into all pontential positions with all possible orientation, and a fit schema is scored by entropy of the extreme points segmented residual space. The fit schema with lowest entropy score will be selected for recursive calls. The recursive is a limited rescursive fit on last few high profitable items, number of recursive call is gradually increasing toward the end of fit sequence. The idea is that last few items often small, moving them around can help finding feasible solutions.

#### single bin

The function __gbp4d_solver_dpp(p, ldhw, m)__ aims to solve four dimensional bin packing (three dimensional none overlapping with weight limit) with repect to packing into a single bin. The inputs are the __profit vector p__ which is a numeric vector defines the item's packing sequence, highest profit first pack, the __item's characterization matrix (ldhw)__ which is a 4 x N numeric matrix with each column corresponding to an item's length, depth, height and weight, and the __bin's characterization vector (m)__ which is a 4 x 1 numeric vector corresponding to bin's length, depth, height and weight limit. The objective is fit as much item volume as possible into the bin. The solution resturned is an instance of __gbp4d__ class.
