CSDP is a software package for solving semidefinite programming
problems. The algorithm is a predictor-corrector version of the
primal-dual barrier method of Helmberg, Rendl, Vanderbei, and
Wolkowicz.

This file includes source for a C code for SDP that uses BLAS and
LAPACK subroutines.  The directories are as follows:

  doc                  documentation.

  lib                  C source for libsdp.a.

  include              Common include files used in lib, theta, and solver.

  solver               C source for a program that reads in problems in
                       SDPA sparse format and solves them.  

  theta                A code for computing the Lovasz Theta number of 
                       a graph.  The theta code solves this problem directly.
                       A program called graphtoprob can be used to produce
                       a problem file in SDPA sparse format.  Also includes a 
                       random graph generator and a program to compute the 
                       complement of a graph.  

  example              A very simple example of how to use the easy_sdp()
                       routine.  This code solves a problem with 2 constraints
                       and 3 blocks in the block diagonal X matrix.  This
                       example is discussed in the user's guide.

  test                 This directory contains test problems to verify that
                       the code works correctly.    

  matlab               MATLAB/Octave routines for interfacing to CSDP.
