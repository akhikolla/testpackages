\title{Dataset: historical data on two single-agents to inform a combination study}
\format{
A tibble with 11 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
  \item{group_id}{study}
  \item{drug_A}{dose of Drug A}
  \item{drug_B}{dose of Drug B}
  \item{num_patients}{number of patients}
  \item{num_toxicities}{number of DLTs}
  \item{cohort_time}{cohort number of patients}
}
}
\usage{
hist_combo2
}
\description{
One of two datasets from the application described in Neuenschwander et al
(2016). The risk of DLT is to be studied as a function of dose for two drugs,
drug A and drug B. Historical information on the toxicity profiles of these
two drugs is available from single agent trials \code{trial_A} and \code{trial_B}.
A second dataset \code{codata_combo2} is available from this application,
which includes additional dose-toxicity data from \code{trial_AB} and \code{IIT} of the
combination of Drugs A and B.
