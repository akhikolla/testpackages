#' MixAll
#' Allows to estimate parametric mixture models with mixed data
#'  sets and missing data.
#'
#' This package contains methods allowing R users to use the clustering methods
#' of the STK++ library.
#'
#' As described at the STK++ project's home page, \url{https://www.stkpp.org},
#' STK++ is a versatile, fast, reliable and elegant collection of C++ classes
#' for statistics, clustering, linear algebra, arrays (with an Eigen-like API),
#' regression, dimension reduction, etc. Some functionalities provided by the
#' library are available in the R environment as R functions in MixAll.
#'
#' The available functionalities are:
#' \enumerate{
#'    \item Clustering (\link{clusterDiagGaussian}, \link{clusterCategorical},
#' \link{clusterPoisson}, \link{clusterGamma}, \link{clusterMixedData})
#'    \item Learning ( (\link{learnDiagGaussian}, \link{learnCategorical},
#' \link{learnPoisson}, \link{learnGamma}, \link{learnMixedData}),
#'    \item Prediction (\link{clusterPredict}).

#' Counting Data: DebTrivedi
#'
#' Deb and Trivedi (1997) analyze data on 4406 individuals, aged 66 and over, who are covered
#' by Medicare, a public insurance program. Originally obtained from the US National Medical
#' Expenditure Survey (NMES) for 1987/88, the data are available from the data archive of
#' the \emph{Journal of Applied Econometrics}.
#' It was prepared for an R package accompanying Kleiber and Zeileis (2008)
#' and is also available asDebTrivedi.rda in the Journal of Statistical Software
#' together with Zeileis (2006). The objective is to model the demand for medical
#' care -as captured by the number of physician/non-physician office and hospital
#' outpatient visits- by the covariates available for the patients.

#' Quantitative data: Old Faithful Geyser
#'
#' The file geyser.rda contains 272 observations from the Old Faithful Geyser
#' in the Yellowstone National Park. Each observation consists of two
#' measurements: the duration (in minutes) of the eruption and the waiting
#' time (in minutes) to the next eruption.
#'
#' Old Faithful erupts more frequently than any other big geyser, although it
#' is not the largest nor the most regular geyser in the park. Its average
#' interval between two eruptions is about 76 minutes, varying from
#' 45 - 110 minutes. An eruption lasts from 1.1/2 to 5 minutes,
#' expels 3,700 - 8,400 gallons (14,000 - 32,000 liters) of boiling water, and
#' reaches heights of 106 - 184 feet (30 - 55m). It was named for its consistent
#' performance by members of the Washburn Expedition in 1870. Old Faithful is
#' still as spectacular and predictable as it was a century ago.
