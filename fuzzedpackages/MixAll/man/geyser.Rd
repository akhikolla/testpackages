\description{
The file geyser.rda contains 272 observations from the Old Faithful Geyser
in the Yellowstone National Park. Each observation consists of two
measurements: the duration (in minutes) of the eruption and the waiting
time (in minutes) to the next eruption.

\details{
Old Faithful erupts more frequently than any other big geyser, although it
is not the largest nor the most regular geyser in the park. Its average
interval between two eruptions is about 76 minutes, varying from
45 - 110 minutes. An eruption lasts from 1.1/2 to 5 minutes,
expels 3,700 - 8,400 gallons (14,000 - 32,000 liters) of boiling water, and
reaches heights of 106 - 184 feet (30 - 55m). It was named for its consistent
performance by members of the Washburn Expedition in 1870. Old Faithful is
still as spectacular and predictable as it was a century ago.
