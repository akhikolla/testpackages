\title{Applies a 2D fractional max pooling over an input signal composed of several input planes.}
\usage{
nn_fractional_max_pool2d(
  kernel_size,
  output_size = NULL,
  output_ratio = NULL,
  return_indices = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{kernel_size}{the size of the window to take a max over.
Can be a single number k (for a square kernel of k x k) or a tuple \verb{(kh, kw)}}

\item{output_size}{the target output size of the image of the form \verb{oH x oW}.
Can be a tuple \verb{(oH, oW)} or a single number oH for a square image \verb{oH x oH}}

\item{output_ratio}{If one wants to have an output size as a ratio of the input size, this option can be given.
This has to be a number or tuple in the range (0, 1)}

\item{return_indices}{if \code{TRUE}, will return the indices along with the outputs.
Useful to pass to \code{\link[=nn_max_unpool2d]{nn_max_unpool2d()}}. Default: \code{FALSE}}
}
\description{
Fractional MaxPooling is described in detail in the paper
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6071}{Fractional MaxPooling} by Ben Graham
}
\details{
The max-pooling operation is applied in \eqn{kH \times kW} regions by a stochastic
step size determined by the target output size.
The number of output features is equal to the number of input planes.
