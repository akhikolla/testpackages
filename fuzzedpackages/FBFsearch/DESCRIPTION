Description: We propose an objective Bayesian algorithm for searching the space of Gaussian directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. The algorithm proposed makes use of moment fractional Bayes factors (MFBF) and thus it is suitable for learning sparse graph. The algorithm is implemented by using Armadillo: an open-source C++ linear algebra library.
