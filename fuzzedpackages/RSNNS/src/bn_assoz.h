/************************************************************************************

   This file is part of SnnsCLib, a fork of the kernel and parts of the gui of 
   the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS), version 4.3.

   The file's original version is part of SNNS 4.3. It's source code can be found at

   http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/SNNS/

   SNNS 4.3 is under the license LGPL v2. We note that source code files of SNNS 4.3 
   state as version "4.2". Base of this fork is SNNS 4.3 with a reverse-applied 
   python patch (see http://developer.berlios.de/projects/snns-dev/).

   SnnsCLib was developed in 2010 by Christoph Bergmeir under supervision of 
   José M. Benítez, both affiliated to DiCITS Lab, Sci2s group, DECSAI, 
   University of Granada

   Changes done to the original code were performed with the objective to
   port it from C to C++ and to encapsulate all code in one class named SnnsCLib.

   Changes in header files mainly include:
   * removed all static keywords
   * moved initializations of variables to the constructor of SnnsCLib

   Changes in cpp code files mainly include:
   * changed file ending from .c to .cpp
   * removed all SNNS internal includes and only include SnnsCLib   
   * static variables within functions were turned into member variables of SnnsCLib
   * function declarations were changed to method declarations, i.e. "SnnsCLib::.."
     was added
   * calls to the function table are now "C++-style", using the "this"-pointer
