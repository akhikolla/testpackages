\title{lineup2: Lining Up Two Sets of Measurements}
\description{
Tools for detecting and correcting sample mix-ups between two sets
    of measurements, such as between gene expression data on two
    tissues. This is a revised version of the 'lineup' package, to be
    more general and not tied to the 'qtl' package.
