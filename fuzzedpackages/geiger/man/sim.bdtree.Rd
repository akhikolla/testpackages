\description{
	simulating phylogenetic trees under a uniform birth-death process
}
\usage{
sim.bdtree(b=1, d=0, stop=c("taxa", "time"), n=100, t=4, seed=0, extinct=TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{b}{per-lineage birth (speciation) rate}
  \item{d}{per-lineage death (extinction) rate}
  \item{stop}{stopping criterion}
  \item{n}{maximum number of taxa in simulation}
  \item{t}{maximum time steps of simulation}
  \item{seed}{random number seed (default is to seed based on the clock)}
  \item{extinct}{ whether to return trees where all lineages have gone extinct (see \bold{Details})}  }
\details{
	Starting from a root node - i.e., two living lineages - this function simulates the growth of a
	phylogenetic tree under a uniform, time-homogeneous birth-death process.  This means that every
	lineage has a constant probability of speciating, and a constant probability of going extinct, per
	unit time.  If birth is greater than death, then the number of lineages is expected to grow exponentially.
	If \code{extinct=FALSE}, the function will build trees until one is simulated with at least one surviving lineage. 
}
\value{
	A phylogenetic tree in 'phylo' format is returned.  If death rate is non-zero, then the returned tree will likely 
	include some extinct lineages (terminating before the present day).  See \code{\link[geiger]{drop.extinct}} for 
	a function to remove these lineages.

\note{ 
	One note of caution: it is easy to set parameter values that result in tremendously \emph{huge} trees.  If the
	function seems to hang up, this could be the problem.

# Pure-birth tree

# Birth-death tree with extinct taxa
# The extinct flag prevents trees with no survivors
