\title{prune specified taxa from a phylogenetic tree}
\description{
  pruning a set of taxa from a tree
}
\usage{
drop.extinct(phy, tol = NULL)
drop.random(phy, n)

}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{phy}{a phylogenetic tree of class 'phylo'}
  \item{tol}{rounding-error tolerance for taxa that do not reach the present day exactly}
  \item{n}{number of random taxa to prune from the tree}
}

\details{
The functions prune taxa from a tree either at random or based either on a temporal criterion (whether the leaves reach the present within a given \code{tol}). By default, \code{tol = min(phy$edge.length)/100}. The result is a tree that has been pruned based on the given criterion. The function \code{is.extinct} will return a vector of the tip labels of inferred extinct taxa (or NULL is no extinct taxa exist).}
