Description: 'Rcpp' bindings to the native C++ implementation of MS Numpress, that provides two compression schemes for numeric data from mass spectrometers. The library provides implementations of 3 different algorithms, 1 designed to compress first order smooth data like retention time or M/Z arrays, and 2 for compressing non smooth data with lower requirements on precision like ion count arrays. Refer to the publication (Teleman et al., (2014) <doi:10.1074/mcp.O114.037879>) for more details.
