 * to calling the "single update" functions.
 * 
 * The functions are separated into the fast_sv and the general_sv
 * variants due to the varying expert options.
 * 
 * These functions get exposed from the shared library and, most importantly,
 * to the R session. Detailed documentation of the parameters can be found
 * in the package manuals (which are generated from R/exports.R for these
 * functions). Type help("svsample_cpp") into your R session.

// Sample the latent states and the model parameters by using the general_sv
// sampler. This algorithm can sample from SV models with asymmetry (leverage),
// and handles a larger class of prior distributions. The sampler employs
// auxiliary mixture sampling for the latent states just like the fast_sv sampler
// but can correct the draws using a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance-rejection step.
// In our experience, this correction is more of a theoretical subtlety than an
// actual practical need.
// For the model parameters, the sampler employs an adaptive random walk
// Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) scheme or an adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin (MALA)
// scheme.
