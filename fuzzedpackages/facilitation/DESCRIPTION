Description: A tool for simulating a variety of spatial individual-based models of
    plant-plant interactions. User-created models can include any number of species, each of
    which can be structured in any number of life-stages, where each life-stage has specific
    death, growth and reproduction rates, as well as specific interaction radius, dispersal
    radius, and interaction effects over each other species/life-stage. Life stages were modeled
    so as to be a stochastic, individual-based version of differential Matrix Population
    Models (Caswell 2001, ISBN:0-87893-096-5). Interactions can be positive
    (facilitation) or negative (competition) and can affect death rates, growth rates or
    reproduction rates. Interactions from multiple numbers are additive, so as to best
    approximate classic population dynamics models such as the logistic model and
    Lotka-Volterra model (Britton 2004, ISBN:9781852335366). All models work in continuous time, implemented as an optimized version
    of the Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie 1976 <doi:10.1016/0021-9991(76)90041-3>) for independent exponential times, and continuous space.
