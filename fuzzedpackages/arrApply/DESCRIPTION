Description: High performance variant of apply() for a fixed set of functions.
  Considerable speedup is a trade-off for universality, user defined
  functions cannot be used with this package. However, 21 most currently employed
  functions are available for usage. They can be divided in three types:
  reducing functions (like mean(), sum() etc., giving a scalar when applied to a vector),
  mapping function (like normalise(), cumsum() etc., giving a vector of the same length
  as the input vector) and finally, vector reducing function (like diff() which produces
  result vector of a length different from the length of input vector).
  Optional or mandatory additional arguments required by some functions
  (e.g. norm type for norm() or normalise() functions) can be
  passed as named arguments in '...'.
