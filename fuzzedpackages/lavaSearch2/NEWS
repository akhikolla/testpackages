* Version 1.5
** User visible change
- add option method.p.adjust="gof" to modelsearch2.

** Internal change
- degrees of freedom for the robust standard error are now computed
  using a modified Satterthwaite approximation.
- sCorrect compute the hessian.

* Version 1.4 <2018-09-21 Fri>
** User visible change
- modelsearch2 is now only based on the score statistic.

* Version 1.3.5 <2018-05-01 Tue>
** User visible change
- add arguments df, cluster to glht2
- argument display is now named print in summary

** Internal change
- remove dependency on tcltk for displaying progress bar with parallel computation.
- prepare for update of ggplot 2.3.0 

* Version 1.3.4 <2018-04-23 Mon>
** User visble changes 
- =calibrateType1= is now a method and support parallel computation
- =summary2=, =compare2=, and =iid2= for =lvmfit= object can compute
  cluster robust standard error.

* Version 1.3.3
** User visble changes 
- add option Ftest to =calibrateType1=.

* Version 1.3.2
** Internal changes
- fix bugs

* Version 1.3.1
** User visble changes 
- New feature: =calibrateType1= to perform simulation studies of the
  type 1 error rate for Wald test in LVM.

* Version 1.3.0 <2018-04-04 Wed>
** User visble changes 
- =summary2= can be called directly.

** Internal changes
- identification of the small sample bias of the variance-covariance
  parameters. This enable to correct the derivatives and not only the
  estimation of the conditional variance.
- =sCorrect= is able to handle missing values
- reorganisation of the structure of the functions in =sCorrect=.
  Only =sCorrect= do real computations and all the results are stored
  in the object (slot sCorrect). The other functions (=summary2=,
  =compare2=, =iid2=, =score2=, =residuals2=) only extract and combine
  information from the object.


* Version 1.2.0 <2018-16-03 Fri>

** Internal changes
- iterative estimation of the small sample bias 

* Version 1.1.0 <2018-02-01 Thu>
** User visible changes
 - The argument =numericDerivative= has been renamed =numeric.derivative=.
 - The argument =adjust.residuals= has been renamed =bias.correct=.
 - The method =dVcov2= has been renamed =sCorrect=.
 - The method =lTest= is now replaced by the method =compare2=.
   =compare2= is similar to =lava::compare= but with small sample correction.
   The argument =C= of =lTest= is now =contrast= in =compare2=.
 - The interaction with the multtest package has been re-organized. 
   There is no more =mlf2= or =mmm2= function. 
   When no small sample correction is needed use =glht=, otherwise =glht2=.
 - The function =createContrast= has been improved.

** Internal changes
 - When possible argument x has been converted to object.
 - Dependency on several packages has been moved from Import to
   Suggest.  This leads to several requireNamespace in the code to
   check the presence of packages.
