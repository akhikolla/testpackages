## geojsonR
<br>

The **geojsonR** package includes functions for processing [GeoJson objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) relying on [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/rfc7946.pdf). The geojson encoding is based on [json11](https://github.com/dropbox/json11), a tiny JSON library for C++11. Furthermore, the source code is exported in R through the *Rcpp* and *RcppArmadillo* packages. More details on the functionality of geojsonR can be found in the [blog-post](http://mlampros.github.io/2017/03/29/geojsonR_package/) and in the package Vignette.
