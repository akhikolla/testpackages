# This file has the purpose to configure the C++ compilation and building options
# passed as command line arguments to the C++ compiler and linker. 

# The following two lines add compiler and linker options for OpenMP headers and
# shared libraries. Yet, for these options to have an effect, the compiler itself
# should support OpenMP, i.e. it should include the appropriate OpenMP headers,
# and the openmp shared library binaries in its distribution (see above comments).
#PKG_CXXFLAGS=$(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) -DARMA_DONT_USE_OPENMP

# The following will set the compiler standard to C++11.
