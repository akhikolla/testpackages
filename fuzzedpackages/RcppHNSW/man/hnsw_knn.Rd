\usage{
hnsw_knn(
  X,
  k = 10,
  distance = "euclidean",
  M = 16,
  ef_construction = 200,
  ef = 10,
  verbose = FALSE,
  progress = "bar",
  n_threads = 0,
  grain_size = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a numeric matrix of data to search Each of the n rows is an item in
the index.}

\item{k}{Number of neighbors to return.}

\item{distance}{Type of distance to calculate. One of:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"l2"} Squared L2, i.e. squared Euclidean.
  \item \code{"euclidean"} Euclidean.
  \item \code{"cosine"} Cosine.
  \item \code{"ip"} Inner product: 1 - sum(ai * bi), i.e. the cosine distance
  where the vectors are not normalized. This can lead to negative distances
  and other non-metric behavior.
}}

\item{M}{Controls the number of bi-directional links created for each element
during index construction. Higher values lead to better results at the
expense of memory consumption. Typical values are \code{2 - 100}, but
for most datasets a range of \code{12 - 48} is suitable. Can't be smaller
than 2.}

\item{ef_construction}{Size of the dynamic list used during construction.
A larger value means a better quality index, but increases build time.
Should be an integer value between 1 and the size of the dataset.}

\item{ef}{Size of the dynamic list used during search. Higher values lead
to improved recall at the expense of longer search time. Can take values
between \code{k} and the size of the dataset and may be greater or smaller
than \code{ef_construction}. Typical values are \code{100 - 2000}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, log messages to the console.}

\item{progress}{If \code{"bar"} (the default), also log a progress bar when
\code{verbose = TRUE}. There is a small but noticeable overhead (a few
percent of run time) to tracking progress. Set \code{progress = NULL} to
turn this off. Has no effect if \code{verbose = FALSE}.}

\item{n_threads}{Maximum number of threads to use. The exact number is
determined by \code{grain_size}.}

\item{grain_size}{Minimum amount of work to do (rows in \code{X} to add or
search for) per thread. If the number of rows in \code{X} isn't sufficient,
then fewer than \code{n_threads} will be used. This is useful in cases
where the overhead of context switching with too many threads outweighs
the gains due to parallelism.}
}
\value{
a list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{idx} an n by k matrix containing the nearest neighbor indices.
  \item \code{dist} an n by k matrix containing the nearest neighbor
   distances.
}
Every item in the dataset is considered to be a neighbor of itself, so the
first neighbor of item \code{i} should always be \code{i} itself. If that
isn't the case, then any of \code{M}, \code{ef_construction} and \code{ef}
may need increasing.

\section{Hnswlib Parameters}{


Some details on the parameters used for index construction and search, based
on \url{https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib/blob/master/ALGO_PARAMS.md}:

\itemize{
  \item \code{M} Controls the number of bi-directional links created for each
  element during index construction. Higher values lead to better results at
  the expense of memory consumption, which is around \code{M * 8-10} bytes
  per bytes per stored element. High intrinsic dimensionalities will require
  higher values of \code{M}. A range of \code{2 - 100} is typical, but
  \code{12 - 48} is ok for most use cases.
  \item \code{ef_construction} Size of the dynamic list used during
  construction. A larger value means a better quality index, but increases
  build time. Should be an integer value between 1 and the size of the
  dataset. A typical range is \code{100 - 2000}. Beyond a certain point,
  increasing \code{ef_construction} has no effect. A sufficient value of
  \code{ef_construction} can be determined by searching with \code{ef =
  ef_construction}, and ensuring that the recall is at least 0.9.
  \item \code{ef} Size of the dynamic list used during index search. Can
  differ from \code{ef_construction} and be any value between \code{k} (the
  number of neighbors sought) and the number of elements in the index being
  searched.
