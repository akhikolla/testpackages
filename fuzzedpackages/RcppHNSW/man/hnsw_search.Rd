\title{Search an hnswlib nearest neighbor index}
\usage{
hnsw_search(
  X,
  ann,
  k,
  ef = 10,
  verbose = FALSE,
  progress = "bar",
  n_threads = 0,
  grain_size = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of data to search for neighbors.}

\item{ann}{an instance of a \code{HnswL2}, \code{HnswCosine} or \code{HnswIp}
class.}

\item{k}{Number of neighbors to return. This can't be larger than the number
of items that were added to the index \code{ann}. To check the size of the
index, call \code{ann$size()}.}

\item{ef}{Size of the dynamic list used during search. Higher values lead
to improved recall at the expense of longer search time. Can take values
between \code{k} and the size of the dataset. Typical values are
\code{100 - 2000}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, log messages to the console.}

\item{progress}{If \code{"bar"} (the default), also log a progress bar when
\code{verbose = TRUE}. There is a small but noticeable overhead (a few
percent of run time) to tracking progress. Set \code{progress = NULL} to
turn this off. Has no effect if \code{verbose = FALSE}.}

\item{n_threads}{Maximum number of threads to use. The exact number is
determined by \code{grain_size}.}

\item{grain_size}{Minimum amount of work to do (rows in \code{X} to search)
per thread. If the number of rows in \code{X} isn't sufficient, then fewer
than \code{n_threads} will be used. This is useful in cases where the
overhead of context switching with too many threads outweighs the gains due
to parallelism.}
}
\value{
a list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{idx} an n by k matrix containing the nearest neighbor indices.
  \item \code{dist} an n by k matrix containing the nearest neighbor
   distances.
}

Every item in the dataset is considered to be a neighbor of itself, so the
first neighbor of item \code{i} should always be \code{i} itself. If that
isn't the case, then any of \code{M}, \code{ef_construction} and \code{ef}
may need increasing.
