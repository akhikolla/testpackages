\title{Compress a raw vector using the LZ4 or ZSTD compressor.}
\usage{
compress_fst(x, compressor = "ZSTD", compression = 0, hash = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{raw vector.}

\item{compressor}{compressor to use for compressing \code{x}. Valid options are "LZ4" and "ZSTD" (default).}

\item{compression}{compression factor used. Must be in the range 0 (lowest compression) to 100 (maximum compression).}

\item{hash}{Compute hash of compressed data. This hash is stored in the resulting raw vector and
can be used during decompression to check the validity of the compressed vector. Hash
computation is done with the very fast xxHash algorithm and implemented as a parallel operation,
so the performance hit will be very small.}
