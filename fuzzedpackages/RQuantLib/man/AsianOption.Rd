\title{Asian Option evaluation using Closed-Form solution}
\description{
  The \code{AsianOption} function evaluates an Asian-style
  option on a common stock using an analytic solution for continuous
  geometric average price. The option value, the common first
  derivatives ("Greeks") as well as the calling parameters are returned.
}
\usage{
\method{AsianOption}{default}(averageType, type, underlying, strike,
	                  dividendYield, riskFreeRate, maturity, 
	                  volatility, first=0, length=11.0/12.0, fixings=26)
}
\arguments{
  \item{averageType}{Specifiy averaging type, either \dQuote{geometric} or \dQuote{arithmetic} }
  \item{type}{A string with one of the values \code{call} or \code{put}}
  \item{underlying}{Current price of the underlying stock}
  \item{strike}{Strike price of the option}
  \item{dividendYield}{Continuous dividend yield (as a fraction) of the stock}
  \item{riskFreeRate}{Risk-free rate}
  \item{maturity}{Time to maturity (in fractional years)}
  \item{volatility}{Volatility of the underlying stock}
  \item{first}{(Only for arithmetic averaging) Time step to first
    average, can be zero}
  \item{length}{(Only for arithmetic averaging) Total time length for
    averaging period}
  \item{fixings}{(Only for arithmetic averaging) Total number of averaging fixings}
}
\value{
  The \code{AsianOption} function returns an object of class
  \code{AsianOption} (which inherits from class 
  \code{\link{Option}}). It contains a list with the following
  components:
  \item{value}{Value of option}
  \item{delta}{Sensitivity of the option value for a change in the underlying}
  \item{gamma}{Sensitivity of the option delta for a change in the underlying}
  \item{vega}{Sensitivity of the option value for a change in the
    underlying's volatility} 
  \item{theta}{Sensitivity of the option value for a change in t, the
    remaining time to maturity}
  \item{rho}{Sensitivity of the option value for a change in the
    risk-free interest rate}
  \item{dividendRho}{Sensitivity of the option value for a change in the
    dividend yield}
}
\details{
  
  When "arithmetic" evaluation is used, only the NPV() is returned.
  
  The well-known closed-form solution derived by Black, Scholes and
  Merton is used for valuation. Implied volatilities are calculated
  numerically.

  Please see any decent Finance textbook for background reading, and the
  \code{QuantLib} documentation for details on the \code{QuantLib}
  implementation.

# simple call with some explicit parameters, and slightly increased vol:
AsianOption("geometric", "put", underlying=80, strike=85, div=-0.03,
            riskFree=0.05, maturity=0.25, vol=0.2)
