\title{
Computation of the log-weight matrix in a gaussian setting.
}
\description{
The function computes the log-weights of all edges in a gaussian setting.
The result should be used in \link{edge.prob} with argument \code{log} set to \code{TRUE}.
Usual values are used as default for the prior normal-Wishart hyperparameters.
Computation can be parallelized by setting \code{nbcores} to more than 2. Parallelization relies on \code{parallel}.
}
\usage{
lweights_gaussian(data, 
      a = ncol(data), 
      mu = numeric(p), 
      au = 1, 
      T = diag(ncol(data), 
      ncol(data)), 
      nbcores = 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
