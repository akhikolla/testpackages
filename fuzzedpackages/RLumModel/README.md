The **R** package ‘RLumModel’ by Johannes Friedrich (University of
Bayreuth, Germany), Sebastian Kreutzer (IRAMAT-CRP2A, Université
Bordeaux Montaigne, France) and Christoph Schmidt (University of
Bayreuth, Germany) provides a collection of various R functions
modelling luminescence signals in quartz and
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, based on energy-band models.

For an introduction and further details, visit the [RLumModel
homepage](http://r-lum.github.io/RLumModel/).

## Installation

### Install the package

To install the stable version from CRAN, simply run the following from
an R console:

``` r
install.packages("RLumModel")
```

To install the latest development builds directly from GitHub, run

``` r
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/RLumModel@master")
```

To install a developer build other than ‘master’, replace the term
‘master’ in the codeline by the name of the wanted developer build.

### Requirements

Depending on your OS please download and install one of the following:

  - *Windows*: [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
    (provided by CRAN)
  - *macOS*: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (provided by
    Apple)
  - *Linux*: [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) often comes pre-installed in
    most distributions. Should [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) be not
    available, however, we kindly refer to the exhaustive collection of
    installation guides depending on the Linux distribution.

## Using RLumModel

### Simple Example

``` r
model <- "Bailey2001"

sequence <- list(
    IRR = c(20, 10, 1),
    TL = c(20, 500, 5))
    
model.output <- model_LuminescenceSignals(
    model = model,
    sequence = sequence,
    verbose = FALSE
)
```
