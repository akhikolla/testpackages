-----

## Changes in version 0.2.1 (13th April, 2017)

### Miscellaneous

  - Fix CRAN NOTE for not declared entry points.
  - Expand tests.

### Bugfixes and changes:

  - simulate\_LM\_OSL():
      - Right call to .set\_ODE\_Rcpp\_LM\_OSL

-----

## Changes in version 0.2.0 (20th January, 2017)

### New functions:

  - set\_ODE\_Rcpp() & set\_ODE\_Rcpp():
      - Changed the main calculations of the ODEs to C++ via Rcpp. This
        results in an extreme fast calculation of ODE calcualtions. Slow
        calculations like DRT or SAR can be solved much faster now.
  - simulate\_RF\_and\_heating():
      - Simulating the process of heating/cooling a sample and detect
        luminescence during irradiation.

### Bugfixes and changes:

  - calc\_concentrations():
    
      - Add maximum change of concentration in specific level to slot
        ‘info’ in every RLum.Data.Curve.

  - calc\_signal():
    
      - As a result of the changes in ‘set\_pars’ the index of the
        luminescence center changed. This was adjusted in
        ‘calc\_signal’.

  - model\_LuminescenceSignals():
    
      - Add new parameter ‘own\_parameters’: Parameter to submit an own
        parameter set for simulations. For further details see vignette
        ‘RLumModel - Using own parameter sets’.
          - Add new parameter ‘own\_state\_parameters’: Parameter to
            submit own state parameters together with an own parameter
            set.
          - Add new parameter ‘own\_start\_temperature’: Parameter to
            submit own start temperature together with an own parameter
            set.

  - set\_pars():
    
      - Changed order in the vectors N, E, s, A, B: The luminescence
        center is now always the last entry. This was necessary to use
        OTOR models with own parameters much easier.
      - Output is now a list and not a RLum.Results object.
          - Add new parameter set “Friedrich2017”.
          - Add new case ‘customized’ for own parameter sets.

  - simulate\_CW\_OSL():
    
      - Remove ‘RLumModel\_ID’ from slot info to slot .pid. This
        RLumModel\_ID describes the order of the command in the
        sequence.

  - simulate\_irradiation():
    
      - New distinction of cases adding the possibility to use own
        pair-production-rates.
          - argument ‘dose = 0’ is now possible without error (\#4,
            thanks to Christoph Burow)

  - simulate\_LM\_OSL(): \* Remove ‘RLumModel\_ID’ from slot info to
    slot .pid. This RLumModel\_ID describes the order of the command in
    the sequence.

  - simulate\_RF(): \* Remove ‘RLumModel\_ID’ from slot ‘info’ to slot
    .pid. This RLumModel\_ID describes the order of the command in the
    sequence. \* New distinction of cases adding the possibility to use
    own pair-production-rates.

  - simulate\_TL(): \* Remove ‘RLumModel\_ID’ from slot info to slot
    .pid. This RLumModel\_ID describes the order of the command in the
    sequence.

  - tests: \* Expanded tests

  - translate\_sequence():
    
      - Hardcoded originator from returning object to
        “model\_LuminescenceSignals()”
          - Add ‘sequence’ to slot ‘info’ in returning RLum.Analysis
            object.
          - Add ‘originators’ to slot ‘info’ in returning RLum.Analysis
            object.

## Changes in version 0.1.2 (2nd September, 2016)

### Bugfixes and changes:

  - Added vignette:
    
      - Added vignette ‘Getting started with RLumModel’.

  - set\_ODE():
    
      - Remove ‘b’, ‘temp’, ‘R’ and ‘P’ from unpacking, because these
        parameters are already stored in parameters.step.
          - Remove distinction of cases ‘model = Pagonis’ or ‘model =
            Bailey’ due to a misstake in Bailey 2001, 2002 and 2004. The
            rate equation for the valence band is wrong. Thanks to an
            unknown reviewer of Friedrich et al. 2016.

  - set\_ODE\_LM\_OSL():
    
      - Remove ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘temp’, ‘R’ and ‘P’ from unpacking, because
        these parameters are already stored in parameters.step.
          - Remove distinction of cases ‘model = Pagonis’ or ‘model =
            Bailey’ due to a misstake in Bailey 2001, 2002 and 2004. The
            rate equation for the valence band is wrong. Thanks to an
            unknown reviewer of Friedrich et al. 2016.

  - simulate\_CW\_OSL():
    
      - Changed ode solver to ‘ode’ with method ‘bdf’ for faster solving
        long illumination times.

  - simulate\_illumination(): \* Changed ode solver to ‘ode’ with method
    ‘bdf’ for faster solving long illumination times.

  - simulate\_irradiation():
    
      - Changed choice of pair-production-rate ‘R’, so that Bailey 2004
        has the right value of 2.5e10.

  - simulate\_LM\_OSL(): \* Changed ode solver to ‘ode’ with method
    ‘bdf’ for faster solving long illumination times.

  - simulate\_RF(): \* Changed choice of pair-production-rate ‘R’, so
    that Bailey 2004 has the right value of 2.5e10.
