\title{Computation of a decision-relative discernibility matrix based on the rough set theory}
\usage{
BC.discernibility.mat.RST(decision.table, range.object = NULL,
  return.matrix = FALSE, attach.data = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{decision.table}{an object inheriting from the \code{DecisionTable} class, which represents a decision system. 
See \code{\link{SF.asDecisionTable}}.}

\item{range.object}{an integer vector indicating objects for construction of the \eqn{k}-relative discernibility matrix. 
The default value is \code{NULL} which means that all objects in the decision table are used.}

\item{return.matrix}{a logical value determining whether the discernibility matrix should be retunred in the output. 
If it is set to FALSE (the default) only a list containing unique clauses from the CNF representation 
of the discernibility function is returned.}

\item{attach.data}{a logical indicating whether the original decision table should be attached as 
an additional element of the resulting list named as \code{dec.table}.}
}
\value{
An object of a class \code{DiscernibilityMatrix} which has the following components: 
\itemize{
\item \code{disc.mat}: the decision-relative discernibility matrix which for pairs of objects from different 
      decision classes stores names of attributes which can be used to discern between them. Only pairs of 
      objects from different decision classes are considered. For other pairs the \code{disc.mat} contains
      \code{NA} values. Moreover, since the classical discernibility matrix is symmetric only the pairs 
      from the lower triangular part are considered.
\item \code{disc.list}: a list containing unique clauses from the CNF representation of the discernibility 
      function,
\item \code{dec.table}: an object of a class \code{DecisionTable}, which was used to compute the
      discernibility matrix,
\item \code{discernibility.type}: a type of discernibility relation used in the computations,
\item \code{type.model}: a character vector identifying the type of model which was used. 
               In this case, it is \code{"RST"} which means the rough set theory.

\description{
This function implements a fundamental part of RST: a decision-relative discernibility matrix. This notion
was proposed by (Skowron and Rauszer, 1992) as a middle-step in many RST algorithms for computaion of reducts, 
discretization and rule induction. A more detailed explanation of this notion can be found 
in \code{\link{A.Introduction-RoughSets}}.
