    Bugfixes
    
    o   MPTinR now warns in case of over-parameterised models estimated using
        the hessian and suggests deactivating it.

                    Released December 2019

    Significant User Visible Changes
    
    o   This is a maintenance update to address CRAN issues, which does not add
        any new features.
    
    o   Removed all links to my now defunct homepage at the University of 
        Freiburg.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   MPTinR now uses a proper NAMESPACE file (i.e., all exported functions 
        are listed individually)
        
    o   select.mpt() should work even if the entered objects have a class 
        attribute of length two.

    o   added 850 ROCs used in the meta-analysis of Klauer and Kellen (2015), 
        see ?roc6.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   The changes made to the FIA calculation for summed data in version 1.7 
        were incorrect. FIA for multiple data sets simply needs to be summed to
        correspond to FIA when these data sets were fitted in a super-model 
        (with separate parameters for each data set). Consequently, the old 
        behavior of simply summing FIA was restored in both fit.mpt et al. and
        select.mpt. Vignette was updated to show this.

    o   all functions from default packages imported.

    o   FIA for first data set was sometimes incorrectly treated
        as different from get.mpt.fia (or fit.mpt).

    Bugfixes
    
    o   select.mpt was still giving wrong FIA values for multiple data 
        sets (used G^2 instead of 0.5*G^2).
    
    o   the summed FIA value in the output from fit.mpt and the like was
        also incorrect (also used G^2 instead of 0.5*G^2)

    o   bug that prevented inequalities to be correctly taken into 
        account for calculation of FIA is corrected (Thanks to 
        Christoph Klauer for noticing this). This bug was introduced in 
        version 1.6.
    
    o   prepare.mpt.fia was not working, fixed.

    o   less messages if show.messages == FALSE.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   summed BIC and FIA values were calculated incorrectly (i.e., 
        the individual values were simply summed which is incorrect due
        to the non-linear nature of the log(n) term). This is now
        corrected for both the output of fit.mpt (et al.) and 
        select.mpt (for which now summed BIC and FIA are always 
        calculated anew for multiple data sets).
    
    o   removed note in documentation that gen.X functions are rather 
        new. They are well tested by now.
        
    o   bmpt.fia should now work without snowfall without throwing a
        warning.

    o   numDeriv is now only imported and not attached.
    
    o   names for models passed to select.mpt are now automatically 
        determined via match.call().
        
    o   changed the maintainer email address.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   C++ code now uses Rcpp attributes.

    o   A bug prohibiting computation of FIA for models without 
        inequality restrictions and with DEBUG flags enabled when 
        compiling should now be resolved. The computation causing it is
        skipped when no inequalities are present.
    
    o   calculating FIA via fit.model did not work for individual data  
        sets.
        
    o   get.mpt.fia: added examples outside dontrun{} blocks running 
        simple fia tests, with and without inequalities.
        
    o   all calls to snowfall prefaced with snowfall:: to avoid CRAN 
        NOTEs.

    Significant User Visible Changes and new Features
    
    o   added numDeriv argument to fit functions (fit.mpt, fit.model, &
        fit.mptinr) which allows to deactivate numerical estimation of 
        hessian (for calculation of CIs) as it may be extremely time

    Significant User Visible Changes and new Features
    
    o   added args.fia argument to fit.mpt and fit.model to pass
        arguments to get.mpt.fia (such as mConst, see below).
        
    o   added function lbmpt.to.mpt to transform a model in
        LBMPT into model equations (thanks to Quentin Gronau 
        and Franz Dietrich).
        
    o   added restrictions argument to make.mpt.cf.
    
    o   added example on how to fit a confidence rating SDT model to
        ?fit.model.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   added mConst argument to bmpt.fia (+ get.mpt.fia) to avoid
        numerical underflows with huge models when calculating FIA.
        see: http://stackoverflow.com/q/20529407/28957
        (this argument should be used carefully).
        
    o   check.model argument in fit.model was also responsible 
        for certain sanity checks in the objective et al.
        This frequently led to errors which are now silently
        dropped.

                    Released November 2013

    Significant User Visible Changes and new Features
    
    o   Most warnings (e.g., concerning unsuccessful optimization
        with analytic gradient) are now messages.
    
    o   Added error message when the objective function did not 
        evaluate successfully with the given starting values.
        
    o   restrictions to constants can now be set to any value 
        (not anymore restricted to be within 0 and 1).
        
    o   fit.model and gen.predictions (et al.) have argument 
        check.model which allows to suppress the check if the 
        expected values of a model sum to 1.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   Removed bug that crashed the main functions when Hessian
        function failed to produce reasonable results. 
    
    o   FIA calculation could fail when determinant of Fisher matrix 
        was below 0 as it did not take the absolute value 
        (as does the original code by Wu et al.). This should be
        fixed now and FIA again works for all (BMPT) models.
    
    o   check.mpt doesn't fail anymore if any of the predictions is 
        NA or NaN.
        
    o   Removed bug that crashed MPTinR when fitting a model with a 
        single free parameter to multiple datasets (bug reported by
        Alberto Mirisola)
        
    o   fit.mpt gives a warning when FIA fails due to model not being
        a BMPT (instead of failing).

                    Released May 2013

    Significant User Visible Changes and new Features
    
    o   Calculation of FIA uses RcppEigen for dramatic speed
        improvements (thanks to Christian Mueller).
    
    o   FIA calculation can also be parallelized, see bmpt.fia 
        (but even in fit.mpt or fit.model, if multicore is not "none",
        or in get.mpt.fia)
    
    o   documentation now says that extra brackets will distort FIA 
        calculation (Thanks to Joachim Vandekerckhove and 
        EJ Wagenmakers)
        
    o   added possibility to specify individual bounds for 
        random starting values (via two element list).
    
    o   multicore fitting now uses load balancing.
    
    o   select.mpt shows how often p < .05 when results consists
        of multiple data sets. (p.smaller.05)
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   Added note that LLKs do not include factorial constant of the
        multinomial PMF.
        
    o   (hopefully) repaired bug in make.mdt() with matrix/data.frame

    o   added function plot.prediction for plotting obersved versus 
        predicted data.
    
    o   added fia.penalty to information criteria output and to select.mpt.
    
    o   added G.Square, df, and p to output of select.mpt
    
    o   argument dataset added to select.mpt. Allows to select only certain 
        datasets for the comparison (argument may be of length > 1).
    
    o   added CITATION file (as our Behavior Research Methods paper finally 
        came out)
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   select.mpt works now if some some models (with multiple datasets)
        were fitted with fit.aggregated = FALSE.
        
    o   select.mpt returns the aggregated GoF (G^2, df, p) when output = "full"
      
    o   You can now pose an order restriction on variables that may also
        be restricted to be equal to others. E.g., the following restriction
        is allowed list("G2 < G3 < G5", "G1 = G2", "G4 = G5") and produces
        the desired results, see r-forge/MPTinR/bugs/restrictionsbug.order.R 
        Note that in this case G1 would be marked as inequality restricted
        instead of equality restricted (which is not the case for G4).

    o   added functions gen.data, sample.data and gen.predictions
        for bootstrapping, generating data and predictions.
    
    o   coments in model and restrictions files are now treated as in R:
        Everything to the right of a # is ignored and NOT the whole line!
    
    o   MPTinR is now byte compiled.
    
    o   make.mdt can now handle a matrix or data.frames building a big mdt file.

                    Changes in MPTinR Version 0.8.x
                    Released February - May 2012

    Significant User Visible Changes and new Features
    
    o   fit.mpt and fit.model (see version 0.7.0) are now just wrappers around 
        the new function fit.mptinr. They produce the appropirate objective, gradient,
        hessian, and prediction function to fit the model.
        
    o   fit.model contains an example of how to fit a SDT. see ?fit.model. 
        Dont forget to set lower.bound and upper.bound when fitting non-MPT models.
    
    o   fit.mptinr is a new function that takes an arbitrary objective function and 
        possibly a gradient, hessian and prediction function to fit categorical
        data (see examples in ?fit.model).
    
    o   fitting for MPT and similar models is done using a gradient function,
        which significantly improves fitting speed. In the rare cases where fitting 
        fails using the gradient a numerical gradient is still used (with warning).
        
    o   The Hessian Matrix for MPTs and similar models is now symbolically 
        derived yielding an exact Hessian matrix (before it was numerically estimated 
        leading to incorrect Hessians whean paramaters were exactly at the boundary).
        
    o   fitting is now based on nlminb instead of optim's L-BFGS-B
        (using L-BFGS-B is available in fit.mpt.old)
    
    o   models and restrictions can now be specified using textConnections instead of 
        only external files. See examples in ?fit.mpt and especially ?fit.model. 
        restrictions can be specified as a list of characters.
    
    o   added make.mdt, a function to make .mdt data files which can be read by multiTree 
        or HMMTree.
        
    o   new argument show.messages added to the fitting function (default = TRUE). If 
        FALSE the time messeages around the fitting algorithm are suppressed. 
        
    o   expanded check.mpt functionality (now gives number of categories and 
        number of independent categories)
    
    o   all fitting functions have the argument fit.aggregated to indicate whether or not
        the aggregated data (for multiple datasets) should be fitted. Default is TRUE
    
    o   summary.llks was renamed to fitting.runs
    
    o   model.info now gives the rank of the Fisher Matrix (instead of the rank of the Hessian Matrix).
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   resolved small bug when fitting using multicore = "individual"
    
    o   no more warning message if CIs cannot be computed.
    
    o   select.mpt now compares aggregated FIA for output = "full"
    
    o   select.mpt now rounds information criteria before determining number of 
        best fits
    
    o   no more warnings by cell counts below 5 (seems unprincipled)
        
    o   fixed bug when restricted parameters were not in the original model
        (now throws a warning, thanks to Alex)

    o   now contains fit.model() a copy of fit.mpt() with arguments for lower and upper bounds
        for the parameters. You should be able to fit a lot more models with this function.
        (fit.model() is slightly slower than fit.mpt() for MPTs)
    
    New Features / Bugfixes
    
    o   MPTinR should now allow easy model files with all types of operators (not only + - *) 
        and even R functions (e.g., pnorm, ...) via the function fit.model()

    Significant User Visible Changes
    
    o   get.mpt.fia modified such that bmpt.fia is only called as often as
        there are differences in the hank.join parameters (i.e., only if
        the ratio between the trees differ, not the ns). As a consequence,
        CFIA is calculated as part of get.mpt.fia. Furthermore, CIs of CFIA
        are not returned by get.mpt.fia.

    o   fit.mpt adjusted to use the optimization of get.mpt.fia (see above)
        for multi-individual fit. That is, fit.mpt now calls get.mpt.fia
        only once (previous were two calls, one for for individual data,
        one for aggregated data).
    
    o   objective function in fit.mpt vectorized (previous was using
        for-loop). Obtained speed up: ~40%.

    New Features / Bugfixes
    
    o   bmpt.fia fixed to deal with models without restricted parameters
        (was necessary as we did not use en empty matrix correctly)

    o   Corrected a bug that lead to a wrong labeling of restricted
        parameters in the mean parameter table for multi-individual fit
        when using sort.param = TRUE.

    o   Corrected a bug in the R implementation of bmpt.fia, when only one
        parameter was fixed.
