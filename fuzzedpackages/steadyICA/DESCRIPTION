Description: Functions related to multivariate measures of independence and ICA:
 -estimate independent components by minimizing distance covariance;
 -conduct a test of mutual independence based on distance covariance; 
 -estimate independent components via infomax (a popular method but generally performs poorer than mdcovica, ProDenICA, and/or fastICA, but is useful for comparisons);
 -order indepedent components by skewness;
 -match independent components from multiple estimates;
 -other functions useful in ICA.
