\title{An interval-valued design ground snow load dataset for Utah that only
  considers depth to load conversions.}
\format{A data frame with 415 rows and 8 variables:

 \describe{
 \item{STATION}{The global historical climatological network (GHCN)
 station identifier}
 \item{STATION_NAME}{The GHCN station name}
 \item{LATITUDE}{Latitude coordinate position}
 \item{LONGITUDE}{Longitude coordinate position}
 \item{ELEVATION}{Elevation of the measurement location (meters)}
 \item{minDL}{The lower endpoint of the interval-valued design snow load as measured in kilopascals (kpa)}
 \item{maxDL}{The upper endpoint of the design snow load interval (kpa)}
 \item{pointDL}{The original point-valued design snow load from the 2018 Utah Snow Load Study (kpa)}

 }}
\usage{
utsnow_dtl
}
\description{
A dataset containing the interval-valued data used in the analysis
of Bean et. at (2019). The 415 measurement locations
included in the dataset are taken from Bean et. al. (2018).
}
\details{
The interval valued kriging analysis described in Bean et. al. (2019) analyzes this dataset on a
 log scale after removing the effect of elevation. An example of predictions using this workflow are
 found in the README associated with this package. Note that this dataset differs from utsnow in that
 intervals only consider differences in depth to load conversions.
