\title{R bindings to the fstlib library}
\description{
R package \code{fstcore} contains R bindings to the C++ \code{fstlib} library which allows interfacing with \emph{fst} files.
It also contains the \code{LZ4} and \code{ZSTD} sources used for compression. \code{fstcore} exists as a package separate from the
\code{fst} package to facilitate independent updates to the \code{fstlib}, \code{LZ4} and \code{ZSTD} libraries and is used as a
backend to \code{fst}.
}
\details{
The fstcore package is based on six C++ libraries or components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{fstlib}: library containing code to write, read and compute on files stored in the \emph{fst} format.
Written and owned by Mark Klik.
\item \strong{LZ4}: library containing code to compress data with the LZ4 compressor. Written and owned
by Yann Collet.
\item \strong{ZSTD}: library containing code to compress data with the ZSTD compressor. Written by
Yann Collet and owned by Facebook, Inc.
\item \strong{libdivsufsort-lite}: a  lightweight suffix array construction algorithm. This code is bundled with
the ZSTD compression library. Written and owned by Yuta Mori.
\item \strong{sources from zstdmt}: a multithreading library for Brotli, Lizard, LZ4, LZ5 and Zstandard.  This code is
bundled with the ZSTD library. Written and owned by Tino Reichardt.
\item \strong{source file zstd_opt.h}: Price functions for optimal parser. Written and owned by Yann Collet and Przemyslaw
Skibinski. This code is bundled with the ZSTD library.
