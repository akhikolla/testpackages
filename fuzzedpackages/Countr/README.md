Flexible univariate count models based on renewal processes. The models may
include covariates and can be specified with familiar formula syntax as in `glm()`
and package 'flexsurv'.  The methodology is described in a forthcoming paper in
the Journal of Statistical Software. The paper is included as vignette
`vignette("Countr_guide")` along wth several additional vignettes containing
worked examples and additional details, see
