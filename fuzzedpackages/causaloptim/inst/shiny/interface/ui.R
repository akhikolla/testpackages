## multiple connections are allowed from left to right. But nothing from right to left.
## only nodes on the left, all connections are assumed. Only observables on the left.
## parameters are the joint distribution of the observables on the right 
## conditional on the observables on the right
## allow for monotonicity specification on the arrows
## allow for exposure marking on the graph. Then the default estimand is the total effect
