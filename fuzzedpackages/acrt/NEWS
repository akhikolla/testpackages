Changes in Version 1.0.1 

o In Makevars and Makevars.win: 'PKG_LIBS= -fopenmp -lgomp' was replaced by 'PKG_LIBS=$(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)'
o OpenMp is now used conditionally (in 'test.statistic.cpp' and 'test.statistic.Eicker.cpp') to make the package also usable in case OpenMp is not supported. 
o The .Rd files were updated with the information that parallelization through the parameter 'cores' in the functions 'F.type.test.statistic', 'size', and 'critical.value' is only operative in case OpenMp is supported.
o Some references were updated in the .Rd files.
o The DESCRIPTION file was updated.
