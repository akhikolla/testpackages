\usage{
data("metric")
}
\value{
A data.table object with 19900 rows (one per sample pair, non symmetrical) and 3 columns ("ind1", "ind2", "value") 
containing respectively the first sample name, the second sample name and the value of their relation.
}
\description{
The individuals were simulated as described in the \code{\link{samples}} section.
The value is a genetic distance (Ã¢ estimator in Rousset, 2000) computed between the 
200 simulated samples using SPAGeDi v1.4 (Hardy & Vekemans, 2002).
