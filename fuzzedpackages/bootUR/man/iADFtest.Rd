\usage{
iADFtest(y, level = 0.05, boot = "AWB", B = 1999, l = NULL,
  ar_AWB = NULL, union = TRUE, p_min = 0, p_max = NULL, ic = "MAIC",
  dc = NULL, detr = NULL, ic_scale = TRUE, verbose = FALSE,
  show_progress = FALSE, do_parallel = FALSE, nc = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A \eqn{T}-dimensional vector or a (\eqn{T} x \eqn{N})-matrix of \eqn{N} time series with \eqn{T} observations to be tested for unit roots. Data may also be in a time series format (e.g. \code{ts}, \code{zoo} or \code{xts}), or a data frame, as long as each column represents a single time series.}

\item{level}{Desired significance level of the unit root test. Default is 0.05.}

\item{boot}{String for bootstrap method to be used. Options are
\describe{
\item{\code{"MBB"}}{Moving blocks bootstrap (Paparoditis and Politis, 2003; Palm, Smeekes and Urbain, 2011);}
\item{\code{"BWB"}}{Block wild bootstrap (Shao, 2011; Smeekes and Urbain, 2014a);}
\item{\code{"DWB"}}{Dependent wild bootstrap (Shao, 2010; Smeekes and Urbain, 2014a; Rho and Shao, 2019);}
\item{\code{"AWB"}}{Autoregressive wild bootstrap (Smeekes and Urbain, 2014a; Friedrich, Smeekes and Urbain, 2020), this is the default;}
\item{\code{"SB"}}{Sieve bootstrap (Chang and Park, 2003; Palm, Smeekes and Urbain, 2008; Smeekes, 2013);}
\item{\code{"SWB"}}{Sieve wild boostrap (Cavaliere and Taylor, 2009; Smeekes and Taylor, 2012).}
}}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap replications. Default is 1999.}

\item{l}{Desired 'block length' in the bootstrap. For the MBB, BWB and DWB boostrap, this is a genuine block length. For the AWB boostrap, the block length is transformed into an autoregressive parameter via the formula \eqn{0.01^(1/l)} as in Smeekes and Urbain (2014a); this can be overwritten by setting \code{ar_AWB} directly. Default sets the block length as a function of the time series length T, via the rule \eqn{l = 1.75 T^(1/3)} of Palm, Smeekes and Urbain (2011).}

\item{ar_AWB}{Autoregressive parameter used in the AWB bootstrap method (\code{boot = "AWB"}). Can be used to set the parameter directly rather than via the default link to the block length l.}

\item{union}{Logical indicator whether or not to use bootstrap union tests (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}), see Smeekes and Taylor (2012). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{p_min}{Minimum lag length in the augmented Dickey-Fuller regression. Default is 0.}

\item{p_max}{Maximum lag length in the augmented Dickey-Fuller regression. Default uses the sample size-based rule \eqn{12(T/100)^{1/4}}.}

\item{ic}{String for information criterion used to select the lag length in the augmented Dickey-Fuller regression. Options are: \code{"AIC"}, \code{"BIC"}, \code{"MAIC"}, \code{"MBIC"}. Default is \code{"MAIC"} (Ng and Perron, 2001).}

\item{dc}{Numeric vector indicating the deterministic specification. Only relevant if \code{union = FALSE}. Options are (combinations of)

\verb{0 } no deterministics;

\verb{1 } intercept only;

\verb{2 } intercept and trend.

If \code{union = FALSE}, the default is adding an intercept (a warning is given).}

\item{detr}{String vector indicating the type of detrending to be performed. Only relevant if \code{union = FALSE}. Options are: \code{"OLS"} and/or \code{"QD"} (typically also called GLS, see Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock, 1996). The default is \code{"OLS"}.}

\item{ic_scale}{Logical indicator whether or not to use the rescaled information criteria of Cavaliere et al. (2015) (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicator whether or not information on the outcome of the unit root test needs to be printed to the console. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{show_progress}{Logical indicator whether a bootstrap progress update should be printed to the console. Default is FALSE.}

\item{do_parallel}{Logical indicator whether bootstrap loop should be executed in parallel. Parallel computing is only available if OpenMP can be used, if not this option is ignored. Default is FALSE.}

\item{nc}{The number of cores to be used in the parallel loops. Default is to use all but one.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components
\item{\code{rej_H0}}{Logical indicator whether the null hypothesis of a unit root is rejected (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE});}
\item{\code{ADF_tests}}{Details on the unit root tests: value of the test statistics and p-values.}
For the union test (\code{union = TRUE}), the output is arranged per time series. If \code{union = FALSE}, the output is arranged per time series, type of deterministic component (\code{dc}) and detrending method (\code{detr}).
}
\description{
This function performs bootstrap unit root tests on each time series individually.
}
\details{
The options encompass many test proposed in the literature. \code{dc = "OLS"} gives the standard augmented Dickey-Fuller test, while \code{dc = "QD"} provides the DF-GLS test of Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1996). The bootstrap algorithm is always based on a residual bootstrap (under the alternative) to obtain residuals rather than a difference-based bootstrap (under the null), see e.g. Palm, Smeekes and Urbain (2008).

Lag length selection is done automatically in the ADF regression with the specified information criterion. If one of the modified criteria of Ng and Perron (2001) is used, the correction of Perron and Qu (2008) is applied. For very short time series (fewer than 50 time points) the maximum lag length is adjusted downward to avoid potential multicollinearity issues in the bootstrap. To overwrite data-driven lag length selection with a pre-specified lag length, simply set both the minimum `p_min` and maximum lag length `p_max` for the selection algorithm equal to the desired lag length.

\section{Warnings}{

The function may give the following warnings.
\describe{
\item{\code{Warning: Missing values cause resampling bootstrap to be executed for each time series individually.}}{If the time series in \code{y} have different starting and end points (and thus some series contain \code{NA} values at the beginning and/or end of the sample, the resampling-based moving block bootstrap (MBB) and sieve bootstrap (SB) cannot be used directly, as they create holes (internal missings) in the bootstrap samples. These bootstrap methods are therefore not applied jointly as usual, but individually to each series.}
\item{\code{Warning: Deterministic specification in argument dc is ignored, as union test is applied.}}{The union test calculates the union of all four combinations of deterministic components (intercept or intercept and trend) and detrending methods (OLS or QD). Setting deterministic components manually therefore has no effect.}
\item{\code{Warning: Detrending method in argument detr is ignored, as union test is applied.}}{The union test calculates the union of all four combinations of deterministic components (intercept or intercept and trend) and detrending methods (OLS or QD). Setting detrending methods manually therefore has no effect.}
