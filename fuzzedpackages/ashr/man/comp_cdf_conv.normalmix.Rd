\title{comp_cdf_conv.normalmix}
\usage{
\method{comp_cdf_conv}{normalmix}(m, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{mixture distribution with k components}

\item{data}{a list with components x and s to be interpreted as a normally-distributed observation and its standard error}
}
\value{
a k by n matrix
}
\description{
returns cdf of convolution of each component of a
    normal mixture with N(0,s^2) at x. Note that
    convolution of two normals is normal, so it works that way
}
