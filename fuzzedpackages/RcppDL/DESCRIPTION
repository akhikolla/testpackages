Description: This package is based on the C++ code from Yusuke Sugomori,
             which implements basic machine learning methods with 
             many layers (deep learning), including dA (Denoising Autoencoder), 
             SdA (Stacked Denoising Autoencoder), RBM (Restricted Boltzmann machine) and 
             DBN (Deep Belief Nets).
