#' @details This rating method was initially designed for games between two
#' players. There will be an error if in `cr_data` there is a game not between
#' two players. Convert input competition results manually or with
#' [to_pairgames()][comperes::to_pairgames()] from `comperes` package.
#'
#' It is assumed that score is numeric and higher values are better for the
#' player.
#'
#' Computation is done based only on the games between players of interest (see
#' Players). __Note__ that it isn't necessary for all players of interest to be
#' present in `cr_data` but it might be a good idea in order to obtain plausible
#' outcome rating.
#'
#' The outline of the Colley method is as follows:
#'
#' 1. Compute Colley matrix: diagonal elements are equal to number of games
#' played by certain player _plus 2_, off-diagonal are equal to minus number of
#' common games played. This matrix will be the matrix of system of linear
#' equations (SLE).
#'
#' 1. Compute right-hand side of SLE as 1 + 0.5*("number of player's wins" -
#' "number of player's losses").
#'
#' 1. Solve the SLE. The solution is the Colley rating.

#'
#' @return `rate_colley()` returns a [tibble][tibble::tibble] with columns
#' `player` (player identifier) and `rating_colley` (Colley
#' [rating][rating-ranking]). The mean rating should be 0.5. __Bigger value
#' indicates better player performance__.
#'
#' `rank_colley()` returns a `tibble` with columns `player`, `rating_colley` (if
#' `keep_rating = TRUE`) and `ranking_colley` (Colley [ranking][rating-ranking]
#' computed with [round_rank()]).
