#'
#' @details Keener rating method is based on Head-to-Head matrix of the
#' competition results. Therefore it can be used for competitions with
#' variable number of players. Its algorithm is as follows:
#'
#' 1. Compute Head-to-Head matrix of competition results based on Head-to-Head
#' expression supplied in `...` (see [h2h_mat()][comperes::h2h_mat()] for
#' technical details and section __Design of Head-to-Head values__ for design
#' details). Head-to-Head values are computed based only on the games between
#' players of interest (see Players). Ensure that there are no `NA`s by using
#' `fill` argument. If `force_nonneg_h2h` is `TRUE` then the minimum value is
#' subtracted (in case some Head-to-Head value is strictly negative).
#'
#' 1. Update raw Head-to-Head values (denoted as S) with the pair-normalization:
#' a_{ij} = (S_ij + 1) / (S_ij + S_ji + 2). This step should make comparing
#' different players more reasonable.
#'
#' 1. Skew Head-to-Head values with applying `skew_fun` to them. `skew_fun`
#' should take numeric vector as only argument. It should return skewed vector.
#' The default skew function is `skew_keener()`. This step should make abnormal
#' results not very abnormal. To omit this step supply `skew_fun = NULL`.
#'
#' 1. Normalize Head-to-Head values with `normalize_fun` using `cr_data`.
#' `normalize_fun` should take Head-to-Head matrix as the first argument and
#' `cr_data` as second. It should return normalized matrix. The default
#' normalization is `normalize_keener()` which divides Head-to-Head value of
#' 'player1'-'player2' matchup divided by the number of games played by
#' 'player1' (error is thrown if there are no games). This step should take into
#' account possibly not equal number of games played by players. To omit this
#' step supply `normalize_keener = NULL`.
#'
#' 1. Add small value to Head-to-Head matrix to ensure its irreducibility. If
#' all values are strictly positive then this step is omitted. In other case
#' small value is computed as the smallest non-zero Head-to-Head value
#' multiplied by `eps`. This step is done to ensure applicability of
#' Perron-Frobenius theorem.
#'
#' 1. Compute Perron-Frobenius vector of the resultant matrix, i.e. the strictly
#' positive real eigenvector (which values sum to 1) for eigenvalue (which is
#' real) of the maximum absolute value. This vector is Keener rating vector.
#'
#' If using `normalize_keener()` in normalization step, ensure to analyze
#' players which actually played games (as division by a number of played games
#' is made). If some player didn't play any game, en error is thrown.
#'
#' @section Design of Head-to-Head values:
#'
#' Head-to-Head values in these functions are assumed to follow the property
#' which can be _equivalently_ described in two ways:
#' - In terms of [matrix format][comperes::h2h_mat()]: **the more Head-to-Head
#' value in row _i_ and column _j_ the better player from row _i_ performed than
#' player from column _j_**.
#' - In terms of [long format][comperes::h2h_long()]: **the more Head-to-Head
#' value the better player1 performed than player2**.
#'
#' This design is chosen because in most competitions the goal is to score
#' __more points__ and not less. Also it allows for more smooth use of
#' [h2h_funs][comperes::h2h_funs] from `comperes` package.
#'
#' @inheritSection massey Players
#'
#' @return `rate_keener()` returns a [tibble][tibble::tibble] with columns
#' `player` (player identifier) and `rating_keener` (Keener
#' [rating][rating-ranking]). Sum of all ratings should be equal to 1. __Bigger
#' value indicates better player performance__.
#'
#' `rank_keener()` returns a `tibble` with columns `player`, `rating_keener` (if
#' `keep_rating = TRUE`) and `ranking_keener` (Keener [ranking][rating-ranking]
#' computed with [round_rank()]).
#'
#' `skew_keener()` returns skewed vector of the same length as `x`.
#'
#' `normalize_keener()` returns normalized matrix with the same dimensions as
#' `mat`.
