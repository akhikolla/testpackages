Sub-option 4 converts the Genepop input file into the format required by Linkdos\index{Linkdos program}, a program described by @GarnierD92 and based on @BlackK85. This program performs pairwise linkage disequilibria analyses in subdivided populations and @Ohta82pâ€™s (1982) $D$ statistics.\index{Linkage disequilibrium!Ohta's statistics} The new format is saved in the file *yourdata*`.LKD`. The source Linkdos program (LINKDOS.PAS) and an executable (LINKDOS.EXE) have been distributed with previous versions of Genepop with permission of their authors, and are still available on the [Genepop distribution page](http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/~rousset/Genepop.htm). The executable distributed with Genepop has been compiled for 40 samples, 20 loci and 99 alleles per locus. It may be wise to relabel alleles (option 8.3) before the conversion. @GarnierD92 should be cited whenever this program is used.
