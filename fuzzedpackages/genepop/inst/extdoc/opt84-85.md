### Sub-options 4 and 5: Conversion of population data to individual data
\index{Individual-based analysis!conversion of data for}
These sub-options convert “population” data (with several individuals per `Pop` to “individual” data where each individual is put in a distinct `Pop`. This is useful for individual-based analyses of isolation by distance and, in this perspective, the name of each individual is replaced by what should be its coordinates, that is, either the name of the last individual in the original population (sub-option 4), or the name of each individual if their locations are distinguished (sub-option 5)[^25].
