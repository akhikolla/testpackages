Description: Provides methods for piecewise smooth regression. A piecewise smooth signal is estimated by applying a bootstrapped test recursively (binary segmentation approach). Each bootstrapped test decides whether the underlying signal is smooth on the currently considered subsegment or contains at least one further change-point.
