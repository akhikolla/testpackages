Description: Simulation of the generalized fiducial distribution for normal linear mixed models with interval data. Fiducial inference is somehow similar to Bayesian inference, in the sense that it is based on a distribution that represents the uncertainty about the parameters, like the posterior distribution in Bayesian statistics. It does not require a prior distribution, and it yields results close to frequentist results. Reference: Cisewski and Hannig (2012) <doi:10.1214/12-AOS1030>.
