Title: Detect Differentiation Problems
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2020-02-28

Description: An algorithm based on graph theory tools to detect differentiation
    problems. A differentiation problem occurs when aggregated 
    data are disseminated according to two different nomenclatures. By making the
    difference for an additive variable X between an aggregate composed of categories
    of the first nomenclature and an other aggregate, included in that first 
    aggregate, composed of categories of the second nomenclature, 
    it is sometimes possible to derive X on a small aggregate of records 
    which could then lead to a break of confidentiality.
    The purpose of this package is to detect the set of aggregates composed of 
    categories of the first nomenclature which lead to a differentiation problem, 
    when given a confidentiality threshold. Reference: Vianney Costemalle (2019) <doi: 10.3233/SJI-190564>.
