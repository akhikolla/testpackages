\usage{
efftox_dtps(
  cohort_sizes,
  previous_outcomes = "",
  next_dose = NULL,
  user_dose_func = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  i_am_patient = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort_sizes}{vector of future cohort sizes, i.e. positive integers.
E.g. To calculate paths for the the next cohort of two followed by another
cohort of three, use \code{cohort_sizes = c(2, 3)}.}

\item{previous_outcomes}{Outcomes observed hitherto in the syntax required
by \code{\link{efftox_parse_outcomes}}.}

\item{next_dose}{the dose-level to be given to the immediately next cohort.}

\item{user_dose_func}{optional delegate for deciding dose. A function that
takes a \code{\link{efftox_fit}} as the sole argument and returns the integer
(1-based) dose-level to be given next, or NA to show that no dose should be
chosen and the trial stopped. This function gives the user the opportunity to
build in custom behaviour to tailor the dose selection decision in response
to the insights garnered by the fit model, or recommend that a trial path
be halted immediately. If omitted, the dose ordinarily chosen by the model is
used. An example is given below.}

\item{verbose}{logical, TRUE to get progress messages.}

\item{i_am_patient}{logical, TRUE to show your tolerance for waiting for over 100
models to fit. Set to FALSE by default.}

\item{...}{extra params passed to \code{rstan::sampling}.}
}
\value{
dose pathways in a \code{data.frame}.

\description{
Calculate dose-transition pathways for an EffTox study.
The function \code{\link{efftox_dtps_to_dataframe}} performs a similar
function, but is much less-flexible.
