Description: Extend the 'bigmemory' package with various analytics.
    Functions 'bigkmeans' and 'binit' may also be used with native R objects.
    For 'tapply'-like functions, the bigtabulate package may also be helpful.
    For linear algebra support, see 'bigalgebra'.  For mutex (locking) support
    for advanced shared-memory usage, see 'synchronicity'.
