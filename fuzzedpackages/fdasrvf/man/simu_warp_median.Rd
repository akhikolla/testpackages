\title{Aligned Simulated two Gaussian Dataset using Median}
\format{
A list which contains the outputs of the time_warping function finding the median
}
\usage{
data("simu_warp_median")
}
\description{
A functional dataset where the individual functions are given by:
\eqn{y_i(t) = z_{i,1} e^{-(t-1.5)^2/2} + z_{i,2}e^{-(t+1.5)^2/2}}, \eqn{t \in [-3, 3], ~i=1,2,\dots, 21},
where \eqn{z_{i,1}} and \eqn{z_{i,2}} are \emph{i.i.d.} normal with mean one and standard deviation
0.25. Each of these functions is then warped according to: \eqn{\gamma_i(t) = 6({e^{a_i(t+3)/6} -1 \over e^{a_i} - 1}) - 3}
if  \eqn{a_i \neq 0}, otherwise \eqn{\gamma_i = \gamma_{id}} (\eqn{gamma_{id}(t) = t})
is the identity warping). The variables are as follows: f containing the
21 functions of 101 samples and time which describes the sampling which has been aligned
