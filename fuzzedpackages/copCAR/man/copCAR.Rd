\title{Fit copCAR model to discrete areal data.}
\usage{
copCAR(formula, family, data, offset, A, method = c("CML", "DT", "CE"),
  confint = c("none", "bootstrap", "asymptotic"), model = TRUE, x = FALSE,
  y = TRUE, verbose = FALSE, control = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \dQuote{\code{\link{formula}}} (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. The details of the model specification are given under "Details".}

\item{family}{the marginal distribution of the observations at the areal units and link function to be used in the model. This can be a character string naming a family function, a family function or the result of a call to a family function. (See \code{\link{family}} for details of family functions.) Supported families are \code{binomial}, \code{negbinomial}, and \code{poisson}. When the negative binomial family is used, an initial value for \eqn{\theta} must be passed to the \code{\link{negbinomial}} family function.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from which \code{copCAR} is called.}

\item{offset}{this can be used to specify an \emph{a priori} known component to be included in the linear predictor during fitting. This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector of length equal to the number of observations. One or more \code{\link{offset}} terms can be included in the formula instead or as well, and if more than one is specified their sum is used. See \code{\link{model.offset}}.}

\item{A}{the symmetric binary adjacency matrix for the underlying graph.}

\item{method}{the method for inference. \code{copCAR} supports the continous extension (\dQuote{\code{CE}}), distributional transform (\dQuote{\code{DT}}), and composite marginal likelihood (\dQuote{\code{CML}}).}

\item{confint}{the method for computing confidence intervals. This defaults to \dQuote{\code{none}}. The other options are \dQuote{\code{bootstrap}} (for parametric bootstrap intervals using the quantile method) and \dQuote{\code{asymptotic}} (for intervals computed using an estimate of the asymptotic covariance matrix).}

\item{model}{a logical value indicating whether the model frame should be included as a component of the returned value.}

\item{x}{a logical value indicating whether the model matrix used in the fitting process should be returned as a component of the returned value.}

\item{y}{a logical value indicating whether the response vector used in the fitting process should be returned as a component of the returned value.}

\details{
This function performs frequentist inference for the copCAR model proposed by Hughes (2015). copCAR is a copula-based areal regression model that employs the proper conditional autoregression (CAR) introduced by Besag, York, and MolliÃ© (1991). Specifically, copCAR uses the CAR copula, a Caussian copula based on the proper CAR.


The spatial dependence parameter \eqn{\rho \in [0, 1)}, regression coefficients \eqn{\beta = (\beta_1, \dots, \beta_p)' \in R^p}, and, for negative binomial margins, dispersion parameter \eqn{\theta>0} can be estimated using the continous extension (CE) (Madsen, 2009), distributional transform (DT) (Kazianka and Pilz, 2010), or composite marginal likelihood (CML) (Varin, 2008) approaches.


The CE approach transforms the discrete observations to continous outcomes by convolving them with independent standard uniforms (Denuit and Lambert, 2005). The true likelihood for the discrete outcomes is the expected likelihood for the transformed outcomes. An estimate (sample mean) of the expected likelihood is optimized to estimate the copCAR parameters. The number of standard uniform vectors, \eqn{m}, can be chosen by the user. The default value is 1,000. The CE approach is exact up to Monte Carlo standard error but is computationally intensive (the computational burden grows rapidly with increasing \eqn{m}). The CE approach tends to perform poorly when applied to Bernoulli outcomes, and so that option is not permitted. 


The distributional transform stochastically "smoothes" the jumps of a discrete distribution function (Ferguson, 1967). The DT-based approximation (Kazianka and Pilz, 2010) for copCAR performs well for Poisson and negative binomial marginals but, like the CE approach, tends to perform poorly for Bernoulli outcomes.


The CML approach optimizes a composite marginal likelihood formed as the product of pairwise likelihoods of adjacent observations. This approach performs well for Bernoulli, negative binomial, and Poisson outcomes.


In the CE and DT approaches, the CAR variances are approximated. The quality of the approximation is determined by the values of control parameters \eqn{\epsilon > 0} and \eqn{\rho^{\max} \in [0, 1)}. The default values are 0.01 and 0.999, respectively.


When \code{confint = "bootstrap"}, a parametric bootstrap is carried out, and confidence intervals are computed using the quantile method. Monte Carlo standard errors (Flegal et al., 2008) of the quantile estimators are also provided.


When \code{confint = "asymptotic"}, confidence intervals are computed using an estimate of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimator. For the CE method, the inverse of the observed Fisher information matrix is used. For the CML and DT methods, the objective function is misspecified, and so the asymptotic covariance matrix is the inverse of the Godambe information matrix (Godambe, 1960), which has a sandwich form. The "bread" is the inverse of the Fisher information matrix, and the "meat" is the covariance matrix of the score function. The former is estimated using the inverse of the observed Fisher information matrix. The latter is estimated using a parametric bootstrap.
