\title{Didanosine versus Zalcitabine in HIV Patients}

\description{
  A randomized clinical trial in which both longitudinal and survival data were collected to compare the efficacy and 
  safety of two antiretroviral drugs in treating patients who had failed or were intolerant of zidovudine (AZT) therapy.
}

\format{
  A data frame with 1408 observations on the following 9 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{patient}}{patients identifier; in total there are 467 patients.}
    \item{\code{Time}}{the time to death or censoring.}
    \item{\code{death}}{a numeric vector with 0 denoting censoring and 1 death.}
    \item{\code{CD4}}{the CD4 cells count.}
    \item{\code{obstime}}{the time points at which the CD4 cells count was recorded.}
    \item{\code{drug}}{a factor with levels \code{ddC} denoting zalcitabine and \code{ddI} denoting didanosine.}
    \item{\code{gender}}{a factor with levels \code{female} and \code{male}.}
    \item{\code{prevOI}}{a factor with levels \code{AIDS} denoting previous opportunistic infection (AIDS 
        diagnosis) at study entry, and \code{noAIDS} denoting no previous infection.}
    \item{\code{AZT}}{a factor with levels \code{intolerance} and \code{failure} denoting AZT intolerance and 
        AZT failure, respectively.}
