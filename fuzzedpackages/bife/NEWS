bife 0.7.1 (25.10.2020)

[Major Changes]
- Step-halving is now similar to `glm.fit2()`.
- Fixed an error in the covariance (influence function) of `get_APEs()`.

[Minor Changes]
- Added reference for the bias correction in `citation()`
- Updated some references in the documentation and vignette.
- Fixed some typos in the documentation and vignette.

bife 0.7 (07.01.2020)

[Major Changes]

- Added a generic function `logLik()` that returns the sum of the log-likelihood.
- 'X_new' in `predict()` now also permits data.frames.
- `bife()` now permits to expand functions with `poly()` and `bs()`.
- Added option 'sampling_fe' to `getAPEs()` to impose simplifying assumptions when estimating the covariance matrix.
- Fixed an error in `get_APEs()` related to the estimation of the covariance.
- Fixed a bug in the internal function that is used to estimate spectral densities.

bife 0.6 (24.05.2019)

[Major Changes]

- Major source code cleaning and revision.
- Vignette renamed and revised.
- The asymptotic bias-correction is ported to a post-estimation routine `bias_corr()`.
- Replaced the bias-correction of Hahn and Newey (2004) with the one of Fernandez-Val (2009). Thus it is now also applicable to dynamic models (see vignette).
- The post-estimation routine `apeff_bife()` was renamed to `get_APEs()` and also returns an estimate of the covariance using the delta method.
- Fixed a bug where the number of perfectly classified observations was not reported correctly. This bug also caused the estimates of the average partial effects to be unreliable for small time horizons.
- Some performance tweaks.
- Removed 'acs' data to reduce overall package size.

bife 0.5 (03.03.2018)

[Major Changes]

- Changed the handling of `factor()` in the formula interface. This should now be more in line with
what users expect.
- Removed `fixed()`, since you can use `factor()` now.

[Minor Changes]
- Realigned `print.summary.bife()`.

bife 0.4 (06.05.2017)

[Bug fix]

- fixed a memory-access error in `bife.cpp`.

bife 0.3 (04.05.2017)

[Major Changes]

- Added a generic function `predict()`.
- Additional downgrades to ensure compability with g++ 4.4.x.
- Downgraded compiled code from C++11 to C++98. This ensures compability with older compilers.
- Removed jackknife bias-correction from `bife()` and `apeff_bife()`.
- `apeff_bife()` now uses the full sample instead of a sub-sample of indiviuals with a 
varying response.

[Minor Changes]

- Changed default argument `discrete` of `apeff_bife()` to `NULL`.
- Changed default argument `bias_corr` of `apeff_bife()` to `"ana"`. 

[Bug fix]

- Fixed an issue where `vcov()` was not able to distinguish between corrected and uncorrected 
coefficients.

bife 0.2 (20.02.2017)

[Major Changes]

- Added a function `fixed()` to model additional fixed-effects. See documentation for further details.
- Re-structured compiled code to optimize package size.
- Changed some function and argument names to common naming convention. For instance 
`apeff.bife(..., bias.corr = "ana")` is now `apeff_bife(..., bias_corr = "ana")`.
- Downgraded compiled code from C++11 to C++98. This ensures compability with older compilers.

[Minor Changes]

- Added comments and renamed variables such that they are in line with the notation of the 
corresponding working paper.
- Fixed some typos in documentation. 

[Bug fix]

- Fixed an issue where `bife()` was not able to fit a model with just one explanatory variable.
- Corrected computation of degrees of freedom.

bife 0.1 (29.07.2016)
