Description: We propose to use sparse regression model to achieve variable selection while accounting for graph-constraints among coefficients. Different linear combination of a sparsity penalty(L1) and a smoothness(MCP) penalty has been used, which induces both sparsity of the solution and certain smoothness on the linear coefficients.
