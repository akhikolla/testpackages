\description{
This dataset gives the modelled tree-ring widths for \emph{Picea
abies} at Forstenrieder Park, Munich, Bavaria, Germany. Tree
growth was modeled as a response of low temperatures in previous
and current July and August, high temperatures in current February
and March, and high precipitation amounts in current July and
August.
