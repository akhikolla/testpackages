## Overview

This R package offers functions with a consistent interface to convert
natural language text into tokens. It includes tokenizers for shingled
n-grams, skip n-grams, words, word stems, sentences, paragraphs,
characters, shingled characters, lines, tweets, Penn Treebank, and
regular expressions, as well as functions for counting characters,
words, and sentences, and a function for splitting longer texts into
separate documents, each with the same number of words. The package is
built on the [stringi](http://www.gagolewski.com/software/stringi/) and
[Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/) packages for fast yet correct tokenization
in UTF-8.

See the “[Introduction to the tokenizers
Package](http://lincolnmullen.com/software/tokenizers/articles/introduction-to-tokenizers.html)”
vignette for an overview of all the functions in this package.

This package complies with the standards for input and output
recommended by the Text Interchange Formats. The TIF initiative was
created at an rOpenSci meeting in 2017, and its recommendations are
available as part of the [tif package](https://github.com/ropensci/tif).
See the “[The Text Interchange Formats and the tokenizers
Package](http://lincolnmullen.com/software/tokenizers/articles/tif-and-tokenizers.html)”
vignette for an explanation of how this package fits into that
ecosystem.

## Installation

You can install this package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("tokenizers")
```

To get the development version from GitHub, use
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/tokenizers")
```

## Examples

The tokenizers in this package have a consistent interface. They all
take either a character vector of any length, or a list where each
element is a character vector of length one, or a data.frame that
adheres to the [tif corpus format](https://github.com/ropensci/tif). The
idea is that each element (or row) comprises a text. Then each function
returns a list with the same length as the input vector, where each
element in the list contains the tokens generated by the function. If
the input character vector or list is named, then the names are
preserved, so that the names can serve as identifiers. For a
tif-formatted data.frame, the `doc_id` field is used as the element
names in the returned token list.

The package also contains functions to count words, characters, and
sentences, and these functions follow the same consistent interface.

``` r
count_words(james)
#> varieties 
#>       112
count_characters(james)
#> varieties 
#>       673
count_sentences(james)
#> varieties 
#>        13
```

The `chunk_text()` function splits a document into smaller chunks, each
with the same number of words.

## Contributing

Contributions to the package are more than welcome. One way that you can
help is by using this package in your R package for natural language
processing. If you want to contribute a tokenization function to this
package, it should follow the same conventions as the rest of the
functions whenever it makes sense to do so.
