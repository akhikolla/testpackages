# RoCoCo - An R Package Implementing a Robust Rank Correlation Coefficient and a Corresponding Test
The 'rococo' package provides a robust gamma rank correlation
coefficient along with a permutation-based rank correlation test.
The rank correlation coefficient and the test are explicitly
designed for dealing with noisy numerical data.

This is the source code repository. The package can be installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rococo).
Further information and installation instructions are also available from
http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/rococo/.

Although the package is maintained by Ulrich Bodenhofer, large parts of the
package itself have been implemented by Martin Krone.
