Description: Creates lowpass filters which are commonly used in ion channel recordings. It supports generation of random numbers that are filtered, i.e. follow a model for ion channel recordings, see <doi:10.1109/TNB.2018.2845126>. Furthermore, time continuous convolutions of piecewise constant signals with the kernel of lowpass filters can be computed.
