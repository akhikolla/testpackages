Description: Efficient computations for null models that require shuffling columns on big matrix data.
             This package provides functions for faster computation of diversity measure statistics
             when independent random shuffling is applied to the columns of a given matrix. 
             Given a diversity measure f and a matrix M, the provided functions can generate random samples 
             (shuffled matrix rows of M), the mean and variance of f, and the p-values of this measure 
             for two different null models that involve independent random shuffling of the columns of M.
             The package supports computations of alpha and beta diversity measures.
