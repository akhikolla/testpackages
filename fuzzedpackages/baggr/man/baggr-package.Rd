\title{baggr - a package for Bayesian meta-analysis}
\description{
This is \emph{baggr} (pronounced as \emph{bagger} or \emph{badger}), a Bayesian meta-analysis
package for R using \href{https://mc-stan.org/}{Stan}.
\emph{Baggr} is intended to be user-friendly and transparent so that
it's easier to understand the models you are building and criticise them.
}
\details{
\emph{Baggr} package provides a suite of models that work with both summary data and full data sets,
to synthesise evidence collected from different groups, contexts or time periods.
The \link{baggr} command automatically detects the data type and, by default, fits a partial
pooling model (which you may know as
\href{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4700/what-is-the-difference-between-fixed-effect-random-effect-and-mixed-effect-mode}{random effects models})
with weakly informative priors by calling \href{https://mc-stan.org/}{Stan} to carry
out Bayesian inference. Modelling of variances or quantiles, standardisation and
transformation of data is also possible.
