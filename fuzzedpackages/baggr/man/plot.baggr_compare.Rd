\title{Plot method for baggr_compare models}
\usage{
\method{plot}{baggr_compare}(
  x,
  style = "areas",
  arrange = "single",
  interval = 0.95,
  hyper = T,
  transform = NULL,
  order = F,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{baggr_compare model to plot}

\item{style}{What kind of plot to display (if \code{arrange = "grid"}),
passed to the \code{style} argument in \link{baggr_plot}.}

\item{arrange}{If \code{"single"} (default), generate a single comparison plot;
if \code{"grid"}, display multiple plots side-by-side.}

\item{interval}{probability level used for display of posterior interval}

\item{hyper}{Whether to plot pooled treatment effect
in addition to group treatment effects}

\item{transform}{a function (e.g. exp(), log())
to apply to the values of group (and hyper, if hyper=TRUE)
effects before plotting; when working with effects that are on log scale, exponent transform is used automatically,
you can plot on log scale by setting transform = identity}

\item{order}{Whether to order by median treatment effect by group. If not, this
sorts group alphabetically. The pooled estimate is always listed first, when applicable.}

\item{...}{ignored for now, may be used in the future}
}
\description{
Allows plots that compare multiple baggr models
that were passed for comparison purposes to baggr compare or
run automatically by baggr_compare
