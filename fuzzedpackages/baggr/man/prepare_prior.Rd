\item{prior}{\code{prior} argument passed from \link{baggr} call}

\item{data}{\code{data} another argument in \link{baggr}}

\item{stan_data}{list of inputs that will be used by sampler
this is already pre-obtained through \link{convert_inputs}}

\item{model}{same as in \link{baggr}}

\value{
A named list with prior values that can be appended to \code{stan_data}
and passed to a Stan model.
}
\description{
This is an internal function called by \link{baggr}. You can use it for debugging
or to run modified models.
It extracts and prepares priors passed by the user.
Then, if any necessary priors are missing, it sets them automatically
and notifies user about these automatic choices.
