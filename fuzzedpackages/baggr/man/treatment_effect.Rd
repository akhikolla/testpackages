\title{Average treatment effect in a baggr model}
\usage{
treatment_effect(bg, summary = FALSE, transform = NULL, interval = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{bg}{a \link{baggr} model}

\item{summary}{logical; if TRUE returns summary statistics as explained below.}

\item{transform}{a transformation to apply to the result, should be an R function;
(this is commonly used when calling \code{treatment_effect} from other
plotting or printing functions)}

\item{interval}{uncertainty interval width (numeric between 0 and 1), if summarising}
}
\value{
A list with 2 vectors (corresponding to MCMC samples)
\code{tau} (mean effect) and \code{sigma_tau} (SD). If \code{summary=TRUE},
both vectors are summarised as mean and lower/upper bounds according to
\code{interval}
