#' Pooling metrics for baggr
#'
#' Compute statistics relating to `heterogeneity` (whole model) and
#' `pooling` (for each group) given a [baggr] meta-analysis model.
#' The statistics are the pooling metric by Gelman & Pardoe (2006) or its
#' complement, the _I-squared_ statistic.
#'
#' @param bg output of a baggr() function
#' @param type In `pooling` calculation is done for each of the `"groups"`
#'            (default) or for `"total"` hypereffect(s).
#'             See Details section for how calculation is done.
#' @param summary logical; if `FALSE` a whole vector of pooling values is returned,
#'                otherwise only the means and intervals
#'
#' @details
#' Pooling statistic describes the extent to which group-level estimates of treatment
#' effect are "pooled" (or pulled!) toward average treatment effect in the meta-analysis model.
#' If `pooling = "none"` or "full" in [baggr], then the returned values are always 0 or 1, respectively.
#' If `pooling = "partial"`, the value is somewhere between 0 and 1.
#'
#' **Formulae for the calculations below are provided in main package vignette.** See `vignette("baggr").`
#'
#' #' **Estimate of pooling in a group**: this is the calculation done by `pooling()`
#' if `type = "groups"` (default).
#'
#' In a partial pooling model (see [baggr]), group _k_ (e.g. study) has a treatment effect
#' estimate, with some SE around the real treatment effect (TE).
#' Each TE itself is distributed with mean and variance.
#'
#' The quantity of interest is ratio of variability in \eqn{\tau} to total variability.
#' By convention, we subtract it from 1, to obtain a _pooling metric_ _p_.
#'
#' \deqn{p = 1 - (\sigma(\tau)^2 / (\sigma_(\tau)^2 + se_k^2))}
#'
#' * If \eqn{p < 0.5}, that means the variation across studies is higher than variation within studies.
#' * Values close to 1 indicate nearly full pooling. Variation across studies dominates.
#' * Values close to 0 -- no pooling. Variation within studies dominates.
#'
#' Note that, since \eqn{\sigma_{\tau}^2} is a Bayesian parameter (rather than a single fixed value)
#' _p_ is also a parameter. It is typical for _p_ to have very high dispersion, as in many cases we
#' cannot precisely estimate \eqn{\sigma_{\tau}}. To obtain the whole distribution of_p_
#' (rather than summarised values), set `summary=FALSE`.
#'
#' **Overall pooling (in the model)**
#'
#' Typically it is a single measure of heterogeneity that is of interest to researchers.
#' This is calculated by setting `type = "total"` or simply writing `heterogeneity(mymodel)`
#'
#' In many contexts, i.e. medical statistics, it is typical to report _1-P_, called \eqn{I^2}
#' (see Higgins _et al_, 2003). Higher values of _I-squared_ indicate higher heterogeneity.
#' Von Hippel (2015) provides useful details for _I-squared_ calculations.
#'
#' Same as for group-specific estimates, _P_ is a Bayesian parameter and its dispersion can be high.
#'
#'
#' **Relationship to R-squared statistic**
#'
#' See Gelman & Pardoe (2006) Section 1.1 for a short explanation of how \eqn{R^2}
#' statistic relates to the pooling metric.
