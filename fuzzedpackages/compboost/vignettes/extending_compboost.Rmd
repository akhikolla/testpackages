<hr>

`compboost` was designed to provide a component-wise boosting framework with
maximal flexibility. This document gives an overview about the two main
possibilities of extending compboost with custom functions. We will have 
a look at:

- Using custom losses.
- Using custom baselearner.
- Using custom losses to track performance measures.
- Using custom baselearner to use already implemented baselearner from other
  packages.
