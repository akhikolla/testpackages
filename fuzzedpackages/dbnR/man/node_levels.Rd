\alias{node_levels}
\title{Defines a level for every node in the net}
\usage{
node_levels(net, order, lvl = 1, acc = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{the structure of the network.}

\item{order}{a topological order of the nodes, with the orphan nodes
in the first place. See \code{\link{node.ordering}}}

\item{lvl}{current level being processed}

\item{acc}{accumulator of the nodes already processed}
}
\value{
a matrix with the names of the nodes in the first row and their
level on the second
}
\description{
Calculates the levels in which the nodes will be distributed when plotting
the structure. This level is defined by their parent nodes: a node with no
parents will always be in the level 0. Subsequently, the level of a node
will be one more of the maximum level of his parents.
