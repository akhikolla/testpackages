}
\arguments{
\item{name}{the names of the first time slice, ended in _t_0}

\item{size}{the number of time slices of the net. Markovian 1 would be size 2}

\item{acc}{accumulator of the results in the recursion}

\item{slice}{current time slice that is being processed}
}
\value{
the two column matrix with the blacklisted arcs
