\title{Recommend number of chunks based on input size}
\usage{
recommend_nchunks(
  df,
  type = "csv",
  minchunks = data.table::getDTthreads(),
  conservatism = 8,
  ram_size = df_ram_size()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a disk.frame or the file size in bytes of a CSV file holding the
data}

\item{type}{only = "csv" is supported. It indicates the file type
corresponding to file size `df`}

\item{minchunks}{the minimum number of chunks. Defaults to the number of CPU
cores (without hyper-threading)}

\item{conservatism}{a multiplier to the recommended number of chunks. The
more chunks the smaller the chunk size and more likely that each chunk can
fit into RAM}

\item{ram_size}{The amount of RAM available which is usually computed. Except on RStudio with R3.6+}
}
\description{
Computes the recommended number of chunks to break a data.frame
into. It can accept filesizes in bytes (as integer) or a data.frame
}
\examples{
# recommend nchunks based on data.frame
recommend_nchunks(cars)

# recommend nchunks based on file size ONLY CSV is implemented at the moment
recommend_nchunks(1024^3)
