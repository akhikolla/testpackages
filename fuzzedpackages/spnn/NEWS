Changed in spnn 1.2:

o  The training and prediction functions for spnn have been changed to utilize C++ on
   the backend. This new functionality enables much faster prediction on large data
   sets.

o  New functions have been added for the condensed variant of spnn. For information on
   the condensed spnn, see documentation for cspnn.learn() and cspnn.predict(). 

Changed in spnn 1.2.1:

o  Category names were added as column names for the matrix of probability estimates
   generated by spnn.predict() and cspnn.predict().
