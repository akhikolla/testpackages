\title{Non-stationary Maximal-overlapping Allan Variance}
\usage{
MOAV(n, covmat)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An \code{integer} indicating the length of each vector of consecutive observations considered for the average.}

\item{covmat}{A \code{matrix} indicating the T-by-T covariance matrix of the time series with length T.}
}
\value{
A \code{field <numeric>} that is the theoretical Maximal-overlapping Allan variance for constant-mean non-stationary time series data.
}
\description{
Calculation of the theoretical Maximal-overlapping Allan variance for constant-mean non-stationary time series data.
}
\details{
This calculation of Maximal-overlapping Allan variance is based on the definition on "A Study of the Allan Variance for Constant-Mean Non-Stationary Processes" by Xu et al., 2017, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 24(8): 1257â€“1260.
Here n is an integer larger than 1 and smaller than \eqn{floor\left(log_2 \left(dim\left(covmat\right)[1]\right)\right)-1}{floor(log2(dim(T)[1]))-1}.
