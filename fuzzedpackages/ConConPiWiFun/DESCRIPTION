Description: Continuous convex piecewise linear (ccpl) resp. quadratic (ccpq) functions can be implemented with sorted breakpoints and slopes. This includes functions that are ccpl (resp. ccpq) on a convex set (i.e. an interval or a point) and infinite out of the domain. These functions can be very useful for a large class of optimisation problems. Efficient manipulation (such as log(N) insertion) of such data structure is obtained with map standard template library of C++ (that hides balanced trees). This package is a wrapper on such a class based on Rcpp modules.
