2020/03/10:
 - A new function, GABCEE has been added.
 - Bug fix in ABCEE: When computing the prior distribution, the regression coefficients were not appropriately scaled.
                     This bug did return an error, but results were wrong.
 - Bug fix in ABCEE and NBCEE: The size of the objects containing the results was sometimes incorrect.
                               This bug returned an error message and no results were produced when it occured. 

2017/08/10:
- The ABCEE function now uses Rcpp to improve computational efficiency.
- The ABCEE function now accomodates cases with more than 30 covariates.
- The documentation was enhanced. In particular, it now contains examples of diagnostics for the MCMC.
