\description{
An unstructured simplex requires a choice of mesh points (vertex nodes) and
a triangulation.  This is a simple and short algorithm that improves the
quality of a mesh by relocating the mesh points according to a relaxation
scheme of forces in a truss structure. The topology of the truss is reset
using Delaunay triangulation. A (sufficiently smooth) user supplied signed
distance function (\code{fd}) indicates if a given node is inside or
outside the region. Points outside the region are projected back to the
boundary.
}
\details{
This is an implementation of original Matlab software of Per-Olof Persson.

Excerpt (modified) from the reference below:

\sQuote{The algorithm is based on a mechanical analogy between a triangular
mesh and a n-D truss structure. In the physical model, the edges of the
Delaunay triangles of a set of points correspond to bars of a truss. Each
bar has a force-displacement relationship \eqn{f(\ell, \ell_{0})}{F(L,L0)}
depending on its current length \eqn{\ell}{L} and its unextended length
\eqn{\ell_{0}}{L0}.}

\sQuote{External forces on the structure come at the boundaries, on which
external forces have normal orientations. These external forces are just
large enough to prevent nodes from moving outside the boundary. The
position of the nodes are the unknowns, and are found by solving for a
static force equilibrium. The hope is that (when \code{fh = function(p)
return(rep(1,nrow(p)))}), the lengths of all the bars at equilibrium will
be nearly equal, giving a well-shaped triangular mesh.}

See the references below for all details. Also, see the comments in the
source file of \code{distmesh2d}.
