Description: Downscaling the coarse-resolution remote sensing 
       images into fined-resolution images is important for 
       preprocessing. This package provides the functions for this
       with high accuracy. Currently, the resautonet is used 
       as the deep learning algorithm for downscaling. 
       This work was done based on this paper,
