\usage{
expand(st, k = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{st}{a simplex tree.}

\item{k}{the target dimension of the expansion.}
}
\description{
Performs a k-expansion on the 1-skeleton of the complex, adding k-simplices 
if all combinations of edges are included. Because this operation uses the edges alone to infer 
the existence of higher order simplices, the expansion assumes the underlying complex
is a flag complex.
