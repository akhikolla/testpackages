Description: Various Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms are implemented for item response theory
				(IRT) models. The current implementation includes IRT models for binary and ordinal
				responses, along with dynamic and hierarchical IRT models with binary responses. The
				latter two models are derived and implemented using variational EM.  Subsequent edits
				also include variational network and text scaling models.
