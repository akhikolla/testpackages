Description: Current status data abounds
            in the field of epidemiology and public health, where the only observable data for a subject is
            the random inspection time and the event status at inspection. Motivated by such a current status
            data from a periodontal study where data are inherently clustered,
            we propose a unified methodology to analyze such complex data.
