#' @docType package
#' 
#' @details UComp is a package for time series modelling and forecasting of 
#' Unobserved Components models inspired on the structural family due to A.C. 
#' Harvey (Basic Structural Model: BSM), enhanced with automatic identification 
#' tools by Diego J. Pedregal. The package is designed for automatic identification 
#' among a wide range of possible models for trends, cycles, seasonal and irregular 
#' components. The model may include exogenous variables. ARMA irregular components 
#' and automatic detection of outliers are also possible.
