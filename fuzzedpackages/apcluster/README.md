# APCluster - An R Package for Affinity Propagation Clustering
Implements Affinity Propagation clustering introduced by Frey and
Dueck (2007;
[DOI:10.1126/science.1136800](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1136800)).
The algorithms are largely
analogous to the 'Matlab' code published by Frey and Dueck.
The package further provides leveraged affinity propagation and an
algorithm for exemplar-based agglomerative clustering that can also be
used to join clusters obtained from affinity propagation. Various
plotting functions are available for analyzing clustering results.

This is the source code repository. The package can be installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=apcluster).
Further information and installation instructions are also available from
http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/apcluster/.

The package is maintained by Ulrich Bodenhofer. The package itself has grown
over the years in which multiple students have contributed
significant parts: Johannes Palme, Chrats Melkonian, Andreas Kothmeier, and
Nikola Kostic
