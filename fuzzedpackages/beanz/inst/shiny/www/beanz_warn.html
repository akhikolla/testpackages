    Prior Selection and Sensitivity Analysis</a>
  </h2>

<div class="intro" id="iprior">
<p> For Bayesian analysis, selecting a prior or priors is challenging and there is
    no automatic method that will handle all situations. </p>

<p> In the absence of prior
(empirical) information, we recommend low-information priors, ones that provide
support for a broad range of values. Even here care is needed, especially to
respect the scale of a parameter. For example, a N(0, 10,000) can be either
low information or high information depending on the scale of the regressor and
consequently the slope. Similarly, a Uniform(0,10) prior for a sampling
SD can be either low or high information depending on the measurement scale. We
    recommend careful attention to these issues. </p>

<p> If empirical information is
available, we recommend summarizing it by a probability distribution, for
example the normalized likelihood or if on the estimate and standard error are given, a
N(estimate, c x SE), with c>1, a ``power prior" penalizing to
reflect that the external data are not completely fungible with that in the
current study. If the analyst also determined that the external data were biased
relative to the current study, a N(estimate+delta, c x SE)
prior can be used, however potential bias can also be captured by selecting an
appropriate value for c. </p>

<p> As for all important analyses, we recommend sensitivity analyses relative to
these, very explicit analytic choices. </p>
