  Effect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and congestive heart failure
</div>

<h2 class="hline">Introduction</h2>
<div class="intro">
  <p>We demonstrate the application of our software using the data from a randomized controlled trial of the effect of an Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) called enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and congestive heart failure (CHF).</p>
  <p>Patients were randomized to either placebo (n=1284) or enalapril (n=1285).</p>
  <p>The study showed that enalapril sigificantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure. In the original paper the trial investigators (<a href="http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10011653261/">NEJM 1991</a>) reported an overall treatment effect of 16% reduction in relative risk of mortality (95% CI: 5% - 26%, p-value = .0036).  They also examined the consistency of this overall treatment effect in subgroups which were defined a priori in the study protocol.</p>
  <p>The subgroups were defined according to the following 5 characteristics measured at baseline:k
  <ol>
    <li>sodium level, by tertiles</li>
    <li>whether or not patients used vasodilators other than ACE inhibitors</li>
    <li>ejection fraction, by tertiles</li>
    <li>the cause of CHF (ischemia or other/unknown)</li>
    <li>functional status as per New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes (I - IV)</li>
  </ol>
  The subgroups were defined using one characteristic at a time.  We call this <em>"univariate subgroup analyses."</em>  The univariate subroups are not mutually exclusive and hence, the subgroup effects will becorrelated.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="hline">Analysis Plan</h2>
<div class="intro">
  <p>Here we conduct analyses using multivariate subgroups, i.e. subgroups defined using multiple baseline characteristics.  If we used the original 5 charateristics, we will end up with 144 subgroups (144 = 3 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 4).   This makes the analyses a bit unwieldy, even though our software can easily handle this complexity.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of demonstrating the software, we considered multivariate subgroups defined by only 3 characteristics:   <ol>
    <li>sodium level, by tertiles</li>
    <li>whether or not patients used vasodilators other than ACE inhibitors</li>
    <li>ejection fraction, by tertiles</li>
  </ol>
  This resulted in 18 mutually excusive subgroups.  The point estimate and standard error of these 18 subgroups form the input to our software.</p>
