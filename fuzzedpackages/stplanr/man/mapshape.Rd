\title{Simplify geometry of spatial objects with the mapshaper library}
\usage{
mapshape(shp, percent = 10, ms_options = "", dsn = "mapshape", silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{shp}{A spatial object to be simplified.}

\item{percent}{A number between 1 and 100 stating how aggressively to simplify
the object (1 is a very aggressive simplification)}

\item{ms_options}{Text string of options passed to mapshaper such as}

\item{dsn}{The name of the temporary file to write to (deleted after use)}

\item{silent}{Logical determining whether the function call is printed to screen
\code{no-topology} (a flag) and \code{snap-interval=1} (a key value pair).
See the mapshaper documentation for details:
\url{https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference}.

The percent argument refers to the percentage of removable points to retain.
So \code{percent = 1} is a very aggressive simplication, saving a huge amount of
hard-disk space.}

\section{Details}{


Note: more advance R/mapshaper tools are provided by the rmapshaper
package: \url{https://github.com/ateucher/rmapshaper}.

Calls the JavaScript command-line GIS application mapshaper
(\url{https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper}) from the system
to simplify geographic features, and then tidies up.
mapshaper must be installed and available to \code{\link[=system]{system()}}.
\code{mapshape} writes new a file to disk.
Thanks to Richard and Adrian Ellison for demonstrating this in R.
