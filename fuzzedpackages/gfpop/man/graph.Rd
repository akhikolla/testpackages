\usage{
graph(..., type = "empty", decay = 1, gap = 0, penalty = 0,
  K = Inf, a = 0, all.null.edges = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{This is a list of edges definied by functions "Edge", "StartEnd" and "Node"}

\item{type}{a string equal to "std", "isotonic", "updown", "relevant". to build a predefined classic graph}

\item{decay}{a nonnegative number to give the strength of the exponential decay into the segment}

\item{gap}{a nonnegative number to constrain the size of the gap in the change of state}

\item{penalty}{a nonnegative number equals to the common penalty to use for all edges}

\item{K}{a positive number. Threshold for the Biweight robust loss}

\item{a}{a positive number. Slope for the Huber robust loss}

\item{all.null.edges}{a boolean. Add null edges to all nodes automatically}
}
\value{
a dataframe with 9 variables (columns are named "state1", "state2", "type", "parameter", "penalty", "K", "a", "min", "max") with additional "graph" class.
}
\description{
Graph creation using component functions "Edge", "StartEnd" and "Node"
}
\examples{
UpDownGraph <- graph(type = "updown", gap = 1.3, penalty = 10)
MyGraph <- graph(Edge("Dw","Dw"), Edge("Up","Up"), Edge("Dw","Up","up", gap = 0.5, penalty = 10),
Edge("Up","Dw","down"), StartEnd("Dw","Dw"), Node("Dw",0,1), Node("Up",0,1))
