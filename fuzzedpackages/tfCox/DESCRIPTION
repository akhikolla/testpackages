Description: In Cox's proportional hazard model, covariates are modeled as linear function and may not be flexible. This package implements additive trend filtering Cox proportional hazards model as proposed in Jiacheng Wu & Daniela Witten (2019) "Flexible and Interpretable Models for Survival Data", Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, <DOI:10.1080/10618600.2019.1592758>. The fitted functions are piecewise polynomial with adaptively chosen knots.
