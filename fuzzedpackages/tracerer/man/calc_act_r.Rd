\title{Calculate the auto-correlation time using only R. Consider using
\link{calc_act} instead, as it is orders of magnitude faster}

the auto correlation time

\examples{
  trace <- sin(seq(from = 0.0, to = 2.0 * pi, length.out = 100))
  act <- calc_act_r(
    trace = trace,
    sample_interval = 1
