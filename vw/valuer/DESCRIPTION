Description: Pricing of variable annuity life insurance
    contracts by means of Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo is used to price
    the contract in case the policyholder cannot surrender while
    Least Squares Monte Carlo is used if the insured can surrender.
    This package implements the pricing framework and algorithm described in
    Bacinello et al. (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.insmatheco.2011.05.003>.
    It also implements the state-dependent fee structure
    discussed in Bernard et al. (2014) <doi:10.1017/asb.2014.13> as well as 
    a function which prices the contract by resolving the partial differential equation 
    described in MacKay et al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/jori.12094>.
