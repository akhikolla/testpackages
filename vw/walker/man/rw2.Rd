\title{Construct a second-order random walk component}
\usage{
rw2(formula, data, beta, sigma, nu, gamma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula for RW2 part of the model. Only right-hand-side is used.}

\item{data}{Optional data.frame.}

\item{beta}{A vector of length two which defines the 
prior mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian prior for coefficients at time 1.}

\item{sigma}{A vector of length two, defining the truncated Gaussian prior for 
the slope level standard deviation.}

\item{nu}{A vector of length two which defines the 
prior mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian prior for the slopes nu at time 1.}

\item{gamma}{An optional vector defining a damping of the slope level noises. More specifically, 
the variance of the conditional distribution of state_t+1 given state is of form gamma_t * sigma.}

\description{
Auxiliary function used inside of the formula of \code{walker}.
