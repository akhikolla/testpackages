<h2>Cancer Vaccine Phase I Design with Simultaneous Evaluation of Immunogenecity and Toxicity</h2>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This package contains the functions for implementing the <strong>visit</strong> design for
Phase I cancer vaccine trials.
</p>


<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Phase I clinical trials are the first step in drug development to apply a new
drug or drug combination on humans. Typical designs of Phase I trials use
toxicity as the primary endpoint and aim to find the maximum tolerable
dosage. However, these designs are generally inapplicable for the development
of cancer vaccines because the primary objectives of a cancer vaccine Phase I
trial often include determining whether the vaccine shows biologic activity.
</p>
<p>The <strong>visit</strong> design allows dose escalation to simultaneously account
for immunogenicity and toxicity. It uses lower dose levels as the reference
for determining if the current dose level is optimal in terms of immune
response. It also ensures subject safety by capping the toxicity rate with a
given upper bound. These two criteria are simultaneously evaluated using an
intuitive decision region that avoids complicated safety and immunogenicity
trade-off elicitation from physicians.
</p>
<p>There are several considerations that are clinically necessary for developing
the design algorithm. First, we assume that there is a non-decreasing
relationship that exists between toxicity and dosage, i.e., the toxicity risk
does not decrease as dose level increases. Second, the immune response rate
may reach a plateau or even start to decline as the dose level increases.
</p>


<h4>Notation</h4>

<p>For subject \(s\), let \(D_s=l\) (\(l=1,&hellip;,L\)) denote the received
dose level, \(T_s=1\) if any DLT event is observed from the subject and
\(0\) otherwise, \(R_s=1\) if immune response is achieved for the subject
and \(0\) otherwise.
</p>
<p>Let \(&theta;^{(l)}_{ij}=P(T=i, R=j|D=l)\) for \(i,j=0,1\),
\(&theta;^{(l)}=\{&theta;_{ij}^{(l)}:i,j=0,1\}\) and \(&Theta; =
\{&theta;^{(l)}: l=1,&hellip;,L\}\). Furthermore, for dose level \(l\), let
\(p^{(l)}=P(T=1|D=l)=&theta;_{10}^{(l)}+&theta;_{11}^{(l)}\) be the DLT risk,
\(q^{(l)}=P(R=1|D=l)=&theta;_{01}^{(l)}+&theta;_{11}^{(l)}\) be the immune
response probability, and
\(r^{(l)}=&theta;_{00}^{(l)}&theta;_{11}^{(l)}/&theta;_{01}^{(l)}&theta;_{10}^{(l)}\)
be the odds ratio. Let \(n_{ij}^{(l)}\) be the observed number of subjects
with \(T=i\) and \(R=j\) at dose level \(l\),
\(n^{(l)}=\{n_{ij}^{(l)}:i,j=0,1\}\) and \(H\) denote all the data
observed by the time the current analysis is conducted.
</p>


<h4>Dose escalation algorithm</h4>

<p>The dose escalation algorithm is based on the posterior probability
distribution of \(&pi;(p^{(l)}, q^{(l)}|H)\), where \(p^{(l)}\) and
\(q^{(l)}\) represent the DLT risk and immune response rate, respectively,
of the current dose level \(l\), and \(H\) denotes the cumulative data at
the time of interim analysis.
</p>
<p>Let \(p_l\) denote the lower boundary of DLT risk below which the dose is
considered absolutely safe, \(p_u\) denote the upper boundary of DLT risk
above which the dose is considered toxic. <strong>visit</strong> implements a sequential
identification approach based on conditional probabilities derived from
\(&pi;(p^{(l)}, q^{(l)}|H)\). Let \(C_1, C_2, C_3\) be fixed cut-off
values in \([0,1]\). The steps are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Step 1.</dt><dd><p>If \(Prob(p^{(l)} &gt; p_U|H) &gt; C_1\), then the current dose level is
considered to be <strong>too toxic</strong>. The trial should be stopped and the next lower
dose level should be reported as the recommended dose.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Step 2.</dt><dd><p>\(Prob(q^{(l)} &le;q q_L| p^{(l)} &le;q p_U, H) &gt; C_2\), then the
current dose level is considered to be <strong>no more effective than its lower dose</strong>
levels. The trial should be stopped and the next lower dose level should be
reported as the recommended dose.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Step 3.</dt><dd><p>If \(Prob(p^{(l)} &le;q p_L| p^{(l)} &le;q p_U, q^{(l)} &gt;
q_L, H) &gt; C_3\), then the current dose level is considered to be <strong>safe and
effective</strong>. The trial will escalate to dose level \(l+1\).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Step 4.</dt><dd><p>The current dose level is considered to be <strong>uncertain</strong>. The
trial should continue to treat more patients at dose level \(l\).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The values of should be chosen \(C_1, C_2, C_3\) prior to study initiation
and reflect the considerations of the investigators and patients. These
thresholds should also give reasonable overall study operating
characteristics.
</p>
<p>We can see that, based on the posterior distribution of \(&pi;(p^{(l)},
q^{(l)}|H)\), the currently dose level is in one of the four regions:
<strong>1: too toxic</strong>, <strong>2: no more effective than its lower dose</strong>,
<strong>3: safe and effective</strong>, and <strong>4: uncertain</strong>. These regions are termed
as a Decision Map.
</p>


<h4>Probability models</h4>

<p><strong>visit</strong> provides several options for the probability models that can
be considered for Bayesian inference. The models are non-decreasing with
respect to the dose-toxicity relationship and avoid monotonic assumptions for
the dose-immune response curve.
</p>


<h3>Non-parametric model</h3>

<p>As one of the simplest models, we posit
no assumptions on the dose-toxicity or dose-immune response relationships and
assume the outcome data \(n_{00}, n_{01}, n_{10}, n_{11}\) follow a
multinomial distribution.
</p>



<h3>Non-parametric+ model</h3>

<p>This is the simplified
<strong>non-parametric</strong> model with the odds ratios \(r=1\). </p>



<h3>Partially parametric model</h3>

<p>Compared to non-parametric models, a
parametric model may allow the incorporation of dose-toxicity, dose-efficacy,
and toxicity-efficacy relationships in dose escalation. In the context of
evaluating cancer vaccines, however, it is difficult to posit assumptions on
the dose-efficacy relationship, since the immune response rate may even
decrease as the dose level increases. On the other hand, it remains
reasonable to assume that the dose-toxicity curve is non-decreasing.
Therefore, we propose a partially parametric model that only makes
assumptions about dose-toxicities but leaves the dose-immune response
relationship unspecified.
</p>
<p>Specifically, we construct the dose-toxicity model as: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">\( \log p^{(l)}=
e^&alpha; \log &tau;^{(l)}. \)</p>
<p> The \(&tau;^{(l)}\)'s are deterministic design
parameters reflecting the expectation of the DLT risk at dose level \(l\)
with \(&tau;^{(l)} &gt; &tau;^{(l')}\) for \(l&gt; l'\).
</p>
<p>For the immune response and the odds ratio, we assume \(q^{(l)}\) and
\(r^{(l)}\) at different dose levels are independent a priori.
</p>



<h3>Partially parametric+ model</h3>

<p>This is the simplified
<strong>partially parametric</strong> model with the odds ratios \(r=1\).</p>
