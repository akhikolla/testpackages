abstract = {A balanced sampling design is defined by the property that the Horvitz–Thompson estimators of the population totals of a set of auxiliary variables equal the known totals of these variables. Therefore the variances of estimators of totals of all the variables of interest are reduced, depending on the correlations of these variables with the controlled variables. In this paper, we develop a general method, called the cube method, for selecting approximately balanced samples with equal or unequal inclusion probabilities and any number of auxiliary variables.},

abstract = {Summary A simple method to select a spatially balanced sample using equal or unequal inclusion probabilities is presented. For populations with spatial trends in the variables of interest, the estimation can be much improved by selecting samples that are well spread over the population. The method can be used for any number of dimensions and can hence also select spatially balanced samples in a space spanned by several auxiliary variables. Analysis and examples indicate that the suggested method achieves a high degree of spatial balance and is therefore efficient for populations with trends.},

abstract = {A new spatial sampling method is proposed in order to achieve a double property of balancing. The sample is spatially balanced or well spread so as to avoid selecting neighbouring units. Moreover, the method also enables to satisfy balancing equations on auxiliary variables available on all the sampling units because the Horvitz–Thompson estimator is almost equal to the population totals for these variables. The method works with any definition of distance in a multidimensional space and supports the use of unequal inclusion probabilities. The algorithm is simple and fast. Examples show that the method succeeds in using more information than the local pivotal method, the cube method and the Generalized Random-Tessellation Stratified sampling method, and thus performs better. An estimator of the variance for this sampling design is proposed in order to lead to an inference that takes the effect of the sampling design into account.

abstract = {Measuring the degree of spatial spreading of a sample can be of great interest when sampling from a spatial population. The commonly used spatial balance index by Grafstr{\"{o}}m et al. (2012) is particularly effective in comparing the level of spatial spreading of different samples from the same population. However, its unbounded and uninterpretable scale of measurement does not allow to assess the level of spatial spreading in absolute terms and confines its use to only raw comparisons. In this paper, we introduce a new absolute measure of the spatial spreading of a sample using a normalized version of Moran's I index. The properties and behaviour of the proposed measure are analysed through two simulation experiments, one based on three artificial populations and the other on a population of real business units located in the province of Siena (Italy).},
