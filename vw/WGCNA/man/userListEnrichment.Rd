Measure enrichment between inputted and user-defined lists
}
\description{
This function measures list enrichment between inputted lists of genes and files containing user-defined lists of genes.  Significant enrichment is measured using a hypergeometric test.  A pre-made collection of brain-related lists can also be loaded.  The function writes the significant enrichments to a file, but also returns all overlapping genes across all comparisons.
}
\usage{
userListEnrichment(
  geneR, labelR, 
  fnIn = NULL, catNmIn = fnIn, 
  nameOut = "enrichment.csv", 
  useBrainLists = FALSE, useBloodAtlases = FALSE, omitCategories = "grey", 
  outputCorrectedPvalues = TRUE, useStemCellLists = FALSE, 
  outputGenes = FALSE, 
  minGenesInCategory = 1, 
  useBrainRegionMarkers = FALSE, useImmunePathwayLists = FALSE,
  usePalazzoloWang = FALSE) 
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{geneR}{
A vector of gene (or other) identifiers.  This vector should include ALL genes in your analysis (i.e., the genes correspoding to your labeled lists AND the remaining background reference genes).  
}
  \item{labelR}{
A vector of labels (for example, module assignments) corresponding to the geneR list.  NOTE: For all background reference genes that have no corresponding label, use the label "background" (or any label included in the omitCategories parameter).
}
  \item{fnIn}{
A vector of file names containing user-defined lists.  These files must be in one of three specific formats (see details section).  The default (NULL) may only be used if one of the "use_____" parameters is TRUE.
}
  \item{catNmIn}{
A vector of category names corresponding to each fnIn.  This name will be appended to each overlap corresponding to that filename.  The default sets the category names as the corresponding file names.
}
  \item{nameOut}{
Name of the file where the output enrichment information will be written.  (Note that this file includes only a subset of
what is returned by the function.) If \code{NULL} (or zero-length), no output will be written out.
}
  \item{useBrainLists}{
If TRUE, a pre-made set of brain-derived enrichment lists will be added to any user-defined lists for enrichment comparison.  The default is FALSE.  See references section for related references.
}
  \item{useBloodAtlases}{
If TRUE, a pre-made set of blood-derived enrichment lists will be added to any user-defined lists for enrichment comparison.  The default is FALSE.  See references section for related references.
}
  \item{omitCategories}{
Any labelR entries corresponding to these categories will be ignored.  The default ("grey") will ignore unassigned genes in a standard WGCNA network.
}
  \item{outputCorrectedPvalues}{
If TRUE (default) only pvalues that are significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (using Bonferroni method) will be outputted to nameOut.  Otherwise the uncorrected p-values will be outputted to the file.  Note that both sets of p-values for all comparisons are reported in the returned "pValues" parameter.
}
  \item{useStemCellLists}{
If TRUE, a pre-made set of stem cell (SC)-derived enrichment lists will be added to any user-defined lists for enrichment comparison.  The default is FALSE.  See references section for related references.
}
  \item{outputGenes}{
If TRUE, will output a list of all genes in each returned category, as well as a count of the number of genes in each category.  The default is FALSE.
}
  \item{minGenesInCategory}{
Will omit all significant categories with fewer than minGenesInCategory genes (default is 1).
}
  \item{useBrainRegionMarkers}{
If TRUE, a pre-made set of enrichment lists for human brain regions will be added to any user-defined lists for enrichment comparison.  The default is FALSE.  These lists are derived from data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (http://human.brain-map.org/).  See references section for more details.
}
  \item{useImmunePathwayLists}{
If TRUE, a pre-made set of enrichment lists for immune system pathways will be added to any user-defined lists for enrichment comparison.  The default is FALSE.  These lists are derived from the lab of Daniel R Saloman.  See references section for more details.
}
  \item{usePalazzoloWang}{
If TRUE, a pre-made set of enrichment lists compiled by Mike Palazzolo and Jim Wang from CHDI will be added to any user-defined lists for enrichment comparison.  The default is FALSE.  See references section for more details.
}
}
\details{
User-inputted files for fnIn can be in one of three formats:

1) Text files (must end in ".txt") with one list per file, where the first line is the list descriptor and the remaining lines are gene names corresponding to that list, with one gene per line.  For example
Ribosome
RPS4
RPS8
...

2) Gene / category files (must be csv files), where the first line is the column headers corresponding to Genes and Lists, and the remaining lines correspond to the genes in each list, for any number of genes and lists.  For example:
Gene, Category
RPS4, Ribosome
RPS8, Ribosome
...
NDUF1, Mitohcondria
NDUF3, Mitochondria
...
MAPT, AlzheimersDisease
PSEN1, AlzheimersDisease
PSEN2, AlzheimersDisease
...

3) Module membership (kME) table in csv format.  Currently, the module assignment is the only thing that is used, so as long as the Gene column is 2nd and the Module column is 3rd, it doesn't matter what is in the other columns.  For example,
PSID, Gene, Module, <other columns>
<psid>, RPS4, blue, <other columns>
<psid>, NDUF1, red, <other columns>
<psid>, RPS8, blue, <other columns>
<psid>, NDUF3, red, <other columns>
<psid>, MAPT, green, <other columns>
...
}
\value{
  \item{pValues}{
A data frame showing, for each comparison, the input category, user defined category, type, the number of overlapping genes and both the uncorrected and Bonferroni corrected p-values for every pair of list overlaps tested.
}
  \item{ovGenes}{
A list of character vectors corresponding to the overlapping genes for every pair of list overlaps tested.  Specific overlaps can be found by typing <variableName>$ovGenes$'<labelR> -- <comparisonCategory>'.  See example below.
}
  \item{sigOverlaps}{
Identical information that is written to nameOut. A data frame ith columns giving the input category, user
defined category, type, and P-values (corrected or uncorrected, depending on outputCorrectedPvalues) corresponding to all significant enrichments.

Three categories of marker genes are presented:
1. globalMarker(top200) = top 200 global marker genes for 22 large brain structures. Genes are ranked based on fold change enrichment (expression in region vs. expression in rest of brain) and the ranks are averaged between brains 2001 and 2002 (human.brain-map.org).
2. localMarker(top200) =  top 200 local marker genes for 90 large brain structures.  Same as 1, except fold change is defined as expression in region vs. expression in larger region (format: <region>_IN_<largerRegion>).  For example, enrichment in CA1 is relative to other subcompartments of the hippocampus.
3. localMarker(FC>2) = same as #2, but only local marker genes with fold change > 2 in both brains are included.  Regions with <10 marker genes are omitted.

ImmunePathway ==> These lists were created by Brian Modena (a member of Daniel R Salomon's lab at Scripps Research Institute), with input from Sunil M Kurian and Dr. Salomon, using Ingenuity, WikiPathways and literature search to assemble them.  They reflect knowledge-based immune pathways and were in part informed by Dr. Salomon and colleague's work in expression profiling of biopsies and peripheral blood but not in some highly organized process.  These lists are not from any particular publication, but are culled to include only genes of reasonably high confidence.
