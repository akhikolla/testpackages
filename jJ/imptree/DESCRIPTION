Description: Creation of imprecise classification trees. They rely on
    probability estimation within each node by means of either the
    imprecise Dirichlet model or the nonparametric predictive
    inference approach. The splitting variable is selected by the
    strategy presented in Fink and Crossman (2013)
    <http://www.sipta.org/isipta13/index.php?id=paper&paper=014.html>,
    but also the original imprecise information gain of Abellan and
    Moral (2003) <doi:10.1002/int.10143> is covered.
