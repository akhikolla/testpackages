\description{
The function \code{hoeffding.D.test} provides
independence testing for two continuous numeric variables,
that is consistent for absolutely-continuous alternative
bivariate distributions.
It implements the classical D statistic by Hoeffding,
which in terms of CDFs estimates the integral of (Fxy-Fx*Fy)^2 dFxy.
It may also be expressed in terms of the ordering types of quintuples
of data points.
Its efficient O(n log n) computation seems to be new in R.
}
\section{P-value}{

The null distribution of the test statistic was described by Hoeffding.
The p-value is approximated by calling the function
\code{\link[TauStar]{pHoeffInd}} from the package \code{TauStar} by
Luca Weihs.

By default, the p-value's \code{precision} parameter is set to \code{1e-5}.
It seems that better precision would cost a considerable amount of time,
especially for large values of the test statistic.
It is therefore recommended to modify this parameter only upon need.

In case that \code{TauStar} is unavailable, or to save time in repeated use,
set \code{precision = 1} to avoid computing p-values altogether.
The \code{scaled} test statistic may be used instead.
Its asymptotic distribution does not depend on any parameter.
Also the raw test statistic may be used, descriptively,
as a measure of dependence.
Only its accuracy depends on the sample size.
}

\section{Ties}{

This package currently assumes that the variables under consideration are
non-atomic, so that ties are not expected, other than by occasional effects of
numerical precision. Addressing ties rigorously is left for future versions.

The flag \code{collisions = TRUE} invokes checking for ties in \code{xs}
and in \code{ys}, and produces an appropriate warning if they exist.
The current implementation breaks such ties arbitrarily, not randomly.

By the averaging nature of the test statistic,
it seems that a handful of ties should not be of much concern.
In case of more than a handful of ties, our current advice
to the user is to break them uniformly at random beforehand.
}

\section{Big Data}{

The test statistic is computed in almost linear time, O(n log n),
given a sample of size n. Its computation involves integer arithmetics
of order n^4 or n^5, which should fit into an integer data type
supported by the compiler.

Most 64-bit compilers emulate 128-bit arithmetics.
Otherwise we use the standard 64-bit arithmetics.
Find the upper limits of your environment using
\enumerate{
\item \code{\link[independence]{max_taustar}()}
\item \code{\link[independence]{max_hoeffding}()}}

Another limitation is 2^31-1, the maximum size and value of
an integer vector in a 32-bit build of R.
This is only relevant for the tau star statistic in 128-bit mode,
which could otherwise afford about three times that size.
If your sample size falls in this range, try recompiling the
function \code{.\link{calc.taustar}}
according to the instructions in the cpp source file.
