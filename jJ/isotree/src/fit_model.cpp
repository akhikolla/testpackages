/*  Fit Isolation Forest model, or variant of it such as SCiForest
* 
* Parameters:
* ===========
* - model_outputs (out)
*       Pointer to already allocated isolation forest model object for single-variable splits.
*       If fitting the extended model, pass NULL (must pass 'model_outputs_ext'). Can later add
*       additional trees through function 'add_tree'.
* - model_outputs_ext (out)
*       Pointer to already allocated extended isolation forest model object (for multiple-variable splits).
*       Note that if 'ndim' = 1, must use instead the single-variable model object.
*       If fitting the single-variable model, pass NULL (must pass 'model_outputs'). Can later add
*       additional trees through function 'add_tree'.
* - numeric_data[nrows * ncols_numeric]
*       Pointer to numeric data to which to fit the model. Must be ordered by columns like Fortran,
*       not ordered by rows like C (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.).
*       Pass NULL if there are no dense numeric columns (must also pass 'ncols_numeric' = 0 if there's
*       no sparse numeric data either).
*       Can only pass one of 'numeric_data' or 'Xc' + 'Xc_ind' + 'Xc_indptr'.
* - ncols_numeric
*       Number of numeric columns in the data (whether they come in a sparse matrix or dense array).
* - categ_data[nrows * ncols_categ]
*       Pointer to categorical data to which to fit the model. Must be ordered by columns like Fortran,
*       not ordered by rows like C (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.).
*       Pass NULL if there are no categorical columns (must also pass 'ncols_categ' = 0).
*       Each category should be represented as an integer, and these integers must start at zero and
*       be in consecutive order - i.e. if category '3' is present, category '2' must also be present
*       (note that they are not treated as being ordinal, this is just an encoding). Missing values
*       should be encoded as negative numbers such as (-1).
* - ncols_categ
*       Number of categorical columns in the data.
* - ncat[ncols_categ]
*       Number of categories in each categorical column. E.g. if the highest code for a column is '4',
*       the number of categories for that column is '5' (zero is one category).
* - Xc[nnz]
*       Pointer to numeric data in sparse numeric matrix in CSC format (column-compressed).
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
*       Can only pass one of 'numeric_data' or 'Xc' + 'Xc_ind' + 'Xc_indptr'.
* - Xc_ind[nnz]
*       Pointer to row indices to which each non-zero entry in 'Xc' corresponds.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
* - Xc_indptr[ncols_numeric + 1]
*       Pointer to column index pointers that tell at entry [col] where does column 'col'
*       start and at entry [col + 1] where does column 'col' end.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
* - ndim
*       How many dimensions (columns) to use for making a split. Must pass 'ndim' = 1 for
*       the single-variable model. Note that the model object pointer passed must also
*       agree with the value passed to 'ndim'.
* - ntry
*       In the split-criterion extended model, how many random hyperplanes to evaluate in
*       order to decide which one is best to take. Ignored for the single-variable case
*       and for random splits.
* - coef_type
*       For the extended model, whether to sample random coefficients according to a normal distribution ~ N(0, 1)
*       (as proposed in [3]) or according to a uniform distribution ~ Unif(-1, +1) as proposed in [4]. Ignored for the
*       single-variable model.
* - sample_weights[nrows]
*       Weights for the rows when building a tree, either as sampling importances when using
*       sub-samples for each tree (i.e. passing weight '2' makes a row twice as likely to be included
*       in a random sub-sample), or as density measurement (i.e. passing weight '2' is the same as if
*       the row appeared twice, thus it's less of an outlier) - how this is taken is determined
*       through parameter 'weight_as_sample'.
*       Pass NULL if the rows all have uniform weights.
* - with_replacement
*       Whether to produce sub-samples with replacement or not.
* - weight_as_sample
*       If passing 'sample_weights', whether to consider those weights as row sampling weights (i.e. the higher
*       the weights, the more likely the observation will end up included in each tree sub-sample), or as distribution
*       density weights (i.e. putting a weight of two is the same as if the row appeared twice, thus higher weight makes it
*       less of an outlier). Note that sampling weight is only used when sub-sampling data for each tree.
* - nrows
*       Number of rows in 'numeric_data', 'Xc', 'categ_data'.
* - sample_size
*       Sample size of the data sub-samples with which each binary tree will be built. When a terminal node has more than
*       1 observation, the remaining isolation depth for them is estimated assuming the data and splits are both uniformly
*       random (separation depth follows a similar process with expected value calculated as in [6]). If passing zero,
*       will set it to 'nrows'. Recommended value in [1], [2], [3] is 256, while the default value in the author's code
*       in [5] is 'nrows' here.
* - ntrees
*       Number of binary trees to build for the model. Recommended value in [1] is 100, while the default value in the
*       author's code in [5] is 10.
* - max_depth
*       Maximum depth of the binary trees to grow. Will get overwritten if passing 'limit_depth' = 'true'.
* - limit_depth
*       Whether to automatically set the maximum depth to the corresponding depth of a balanced binary tree with number of
*       terminal nodes corresponding to the sub-sample size (the reason being that, if trying to detect outliers, an outlier
*       will only be so if it turns out to be isolated with shorter average depth than usual, which corresponds to a balanced
*       tree depth). Default setting for [1], [2], [3], [4] is 'true', but it's recommended to pass higher values if
*       using the model for purposes other than outlier detection.
* - penalize_range
*       Whether to penalize (add +1 to the terminal depth) observations at prediction time that have a value
*       of the chosen split variable (linear combination in extended model) that falls outside of a pre-determined
*       reasonable range in the data being split (given by 2 * range in data and centered around the split point),
*       as proposed in [4] and implemented in the authors' original code in [5]. Not used in single-variable model
*       when splitting by categorical variables.
* - standardize_dist
*       If passing 'tmat' (see documentation for it), whether to standardize the resulting average separation
*       depths in order to produce a distance metric or not, in the same way this is done for the outlier score.
* - tmat[nrows * (nrows - 1) / 2]
*       Array in which to calculate average separation depths or standardized distance metric (see documentation
*       for 'standardize_dist') as the model is being fit. Pass NULL to avoid doing these calculations alongside
*       the regular model process. If passing this output argument, the sample size must be the same as the number
*       of rows, and there cannot be sample weights. If not NULL, must already be initialized to zeros. As the
*       output is a symmetric matrix, this function will only fill in the upper-triangular part, in which
*       entry 0 <= i < j < n will be located at position
*           p(i,j) = (i * (n - (i+1)/2) + j - i - 1).
*       Can be converted to a dense square matrix through function 'tmat_to_dense'.
* - output_depths[nrows]
*       Array in which to calculate average path depths or standardized outlierness metric (see documentation
*       for 'standardize_depth') as the model is being fit. Pass NULL to avoid doing these calculations alongside
*       the regular model process. If passing this output argument, the sample size must be the same as the number
*       of rows. If not NULL, must already be initialized to zeros.
* - standardize_depth
*       If passing 'output_depths', whether to standardize the results as proposed in [1], in order to obtain
*       a metric in which the more outlier is an observation, the closer this standardized metric will be to 1,
*       with average observations obtaining 0.5. If passing 'false' here, the numbers in 'output_depths' will be
*       the average depth of each row across all trees.
* - col_weights[ncols_numeric + ncols_categ]
*       Sampling weights for each column, assuming all the numeric columns come before the categorical columns.
*       Ignored when picking columns by deterministic criterion.
*       If passing NULL, each column will have a uniform weight. Cannot be used when weighting by kurtosis.
* - weigh_by_kurt
*       Whether to weigh each column according to the kurtosis obtained in the sub-sample that is selected
*       for each tree as briefly proposed in [1]. Note that this is only done at the beginning of each tree
*       sample, so if not using sub-samples, it's better to pass column weights calculated externally. For
*       categorical columns, will calculate expected kurtosis if the column was converted to numerical by
*       assigning to each category a random number ~ Unif(0, 1).
* - prob_pick_by_gain_avg
*       Probability of making each split in the single-variable model by choosing a column and split point in that
*       same column as both the column and split point that gives the largest averaged gain (as proposed in [4]) across
*       all available columns and possible splits in each column. Note that this implies evaluating every single column
*       in the sample data when this type of split happens, which will potentially make the model fitting much slower,
*       but has no impact on prediction time. For categorical variables, will take the expected standard deviation that
*       would be gotten if the column were converted to numerical by assigning to each category a random number ~ Unif(0, 1)
*       and calculate gain with those assumed standard deviations. For the extended model, this parameter indicates the probability that the
*       split point in the chosen linear combination of variables will be decided by this averaged gain criterion. Compared to
*       a pooled average, this tends to result in more cases in which a single observation or very few of them are put into
*       one branch.  Recommended to use sub-samples (parameter `sample_size`) when passing this parameter. When splits are
*       not made according to any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl', 'prob_split_by_gain_avg', 'prob_split_by_gain_pl',
*       both the column and the split point are decided at random.
*       Default setting for [1], [2], [3] is zero, and default for [4] is 1. This is the randomization parameter that can
*       be passed to the author's original code in [5]. Note that, if passing value 1 (100%) with no sub-sampling and using the
*       single-variable model, every single tree will have the exact same splits.
* - prob_split_by_gain_avg
*       Probability of making each split by selecting a column at random and determining the split point as
*       that which gives the highest averaged gain. Not supported for the extended model as the splits are on
*       linear combinations of variables. See the documentation for parameter 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg' for more details.
* - prob_pick_by_gain_pl
*       Probability of making each split in the single-variable model by choosing a column and split point in that
*       same column as both the column and split point that gives the largest pooled gain (as used in decision tree
*       classifiers such as C4.5 in [7]) across all available columns and possible splits in each column. Note
*       that this implies evaluating every single column in the sample data when this type of split happens, which
*       will potentially make the model fitting much slower, but has no impact on prediction time. For categorical
*       variables, will use shannon entropy instead (like in [7]). For the extended model, this parameter indicates the probability
*       that the split point in the chosen linear combination of variables will be decided by this pooled gain
*       criterion. Compared to a simple average, this tends to result in more evenly-divided splits and more clustered
*       groups when they are smaller. Recommended to pass higher values when used for imputation of missing values.
*       When used for outlier detection, higher values of this parameter result in models that are able to better flag
*       outliers in the training data, but generalize poorly to outliers in new data and to values of variables
*       outside of the ranges from the training data. Passing small 'sample_size' and high values of this parameter will
*       tend to flag too many outliers. When splits are not made according to any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg',
*       'prob_pick_by_gain_pl', 'prob_split_by_gain_avg', 'prob_split_by_gain_pl', both the column and the split point
*       are decided at random. Note that, if passing value 1 (100%) with no sub-sampling and using the single-variable model,
*       every single tree will have the exact same splits.
* - prob_split_by_gain_pl
*       Probability of making each split by selecting a column at random and determining the split point as
*       that which gives the highest pooled gain. Not supported for the extended model as the splits are on
*       linear combinations of variables. See the documentation for parameter 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl' for more details.
* - min_gain
*       Minimum gain that a split threshold needs to produce in order to proceed with a split. Only used when the splits
*       are decided by a gain criterion (either pooled or averaged). If the highest possible gain in the evaluated
*       splits at a node is below this  threshold, that node becomes a terminal node.
* - missing_action
*       How to handle missing data at both fitting and prediction time. Options are a) "Divide" (for the single-variable
*       model only, recommended), which will follow both branches and combine the result with the weight given by the fraction of
*       the data that went to each branch when fitting the model, b) "Impute", which will assign observations to the
*       branch with the most observations in the single-variable model, or fill in missing values with the median
*       of each column of the sample from which the split was made in the extended model (recommended), c) "Fail" which will assume
*       there are no missing values and will trigger undefined behavior if it encounters any. In the extended model, infinite
*       values will be treated as missing. Note that passing "fail" might crash the process if there turn out to be
*       missing values, but will otherwise produce faster fitting and prediction times along with decreased model object sizes.
*       Models from [1], [2], [3], [4] correspond to "Fail" here.
* - cat_split_type
*       Whether to split categorical features by assigning sub-sets of them to each branch, or by assigning
*       a single category to a branch and the rest to the other branch. For the extended model, whether to
*       give each category a coefficient, or only one while the rest get zero.
* - new_cat_action
*       What to do after splitting a categorical feature when new data that reaches that split has categories that
*       the sub-sample from which the split was done did not have. Options are a) "Weighted" (recommended), which
*       in the single-variable model will follow both branches and combine the result with weight given by the fraction of the
*       data that went to each branch when fitting the model, and in the extended model will assign
*       them the median value for that column that was added to the linear combination of features, b) "Smallest", which will
*       assign all observations with unseen categories in the split to the branch that had fewer observations when
*       fitting the model, c) "Random", which will assing a branch (coefficient in the extended model) at random for
*       each category beforehand, even if no observations had that category when fitting the model. Ignored when
*       passing 'cat_split_type' = 'SingleCateg'.
* - all_perm
*       When doing categorical variable splits by pooled gain with 'ndim=1' (regular model),
*       whether to consider all possible permutations of variables to assign to each branch or not. If 'false',
*       will sort the categories by their frequency and make a grouping in this sorted order. Note that the
*       number of combinations evaluated (if 'true') is the factorial of the number of present categories in
*       a given column (minus 2). For averaged gain, the best split is always to put the second most-frequent
*       category in a separate branch, so not evaluating all  permutations (passing 'false') will make it
*       possible to select other splits that respect the sorted frequency order.
*       The total number of combinations must be a number that can fit into a 'size_t' variable - for x64-64
*       systems, this means no column can have more than 20 different categories if using 'all_perm=true',
*       but note that this is not checked within the function.
*       Ignored when not using categorical variables or not doing splits by pooled gain or using 'ndim>1'.
* - coef_by_prop
*       In the extended model, whether to sort the randomly-generated coefficients for categories
*       according to their relative frequency in the tree node. This might provide better results when using
*       categorical variables with too many categories, but is not recommended, and not reflective of
*       real "categorical-ness". Ignored for the regular model ('ndim=1') and/or when not using categorical
*       variables.
* - imputer (out)
*       Pointer to already-allocated imputer object, which can be used to produce missing value imputations
*       in new data. Pass NULL if no missing value imputations are required. Note that this is not related to
*       'missing_action' as missing values inside the model are treated differently and follow their own imputation
*       or division strategy.
* - min_imp_obs
*       Minimum number of observations with which an imputation value can be produced. Ignored if passing
*       'build_imputer' = 'false'.
* - depth_imp
*       How to weight observations according to their depth when used for imputing missing values. Passing
*       "Higher" will weigh observations higher the further down the tree (away from the root node) the
*       terminal node is, while "lower" will do the opposite, and "Sane" will not modify the weights according
*       to node depth in the tree. Implemented for testing purposes and not recommended to change
*       from the default. Ignored when not passing 'impute_nodes'.
* - weigh_imp_rows
*       How to weight node sizes when used for imputing missing values. Passing "Inverse" will weigh
*       a node inversely proportional to the number of observations that end up there, while "Proportional"
*       will weight them heavier the more observations there are, and "Flat" will weigh all nodes the same
*       in this regard regardless of how many observations end up there. Implemented for testing purposes
*       and not recommended to change from the default. Ignored when not passing 'impute_nodes'.
* - impute_at_fit
*       Whether to impute missing values in the input data as the model is being built. If passing 'true',
*       then 'sample_size' must be equal to 'nrows'. Values in the arrays passed to 'numeric_data',
*       'categ_data', and 'Xc', will get overwritten with the imputations produced.
* - random_seed
*       Seed that will be used to generate random numbers used by the model.
* - handle_interrupt
*       Whether to handle interrupt signals while the process is running. Note that this will
*       interfere with interrupt handles when the procedure is called from interpreted languages
*       such as Python or R.
* - nthreads
*       Number of parallel threads to use. Note that, the more threads, the more memory will be
*       allocated, even if the thread does not end up being used. Ignored when not building with
*       OpenMP support.
* 
* Returns
* =======
* Will return macro 'EXIT_SUCCESS' (typically =0) upon completion.
* If the process receives an interrupt signal, will return instead
* 'EXIT_FAILURE' (typically =1). If you do not have any way of determining
* what these values correspond to, you can use the functions
* 'return_EXIT_SUCESS' and 'return_EXIT_FAILURE', which will return them
* as integers.

/* Add additional trees to already-fitted isolation forest model
* 
* Parameters
* ==========
* - model_outputs
*       Pointer to fitted single-variable model object from function 'fit_iforest'. Pass NULL
*       if the trees are are to be added to an extended model. Can only pass one of
*       'model_outputs' and 'model_outputs_ext'. Note that this function is not thread-safe,
*       so it cannot be run in parallel for the same model object.
* - model_outputs_ext
*       Pointer to fitted extended model object from function 'fit_iforest'. Pass NULL
*       if the trees are are to be added to an single-variable model. Can only pass one of
*       'model_outputs' and 'model_outputs_ext'. Note that this function is not thread-safe,
*       so it cannot be run in parallel for the same model object.
* - numeric_data
*       Pointer to numeric data to which to fit this additional tree. Must be ordered by columns like Fortran,
*       not ordered by rows like C (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.).
*       Pass NULL if there are no dense numeric columns.
*       Can only pass one of 'numeric_data' or 'Xc' + 'Xc_ind' + 'Xc_indptr'.
*       If the model from 'fit_iforest' was fit to numeric data, must pass numeric data with the same number
*       of columns, either as dense or as sparse arrays.
* - ncols_numeric
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Cannot be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - categ_data
*       Pointer to categorical data to which to fit this additional tree. Must be ordered by columns like Fortran,
*       not ordered by rows like C (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.).
*       Pass NULL if there are no categorical columns. The encoding must be the same as was used
*       in the data to which the model was fit.
*       Each category should be represented as an integer, and these integers must start at zero and
*       be in consecutive order - i.e. if category '3' is present, category '2' must have also been
*       present when the model was fit (note that they are not treated as being ordinal, this is just
*       an encoding). Missing values should be encoded as negative numbers such as (-1). The encoding
*       must be the same as was used in the data to which the model was fit.
*       If the model from 'fit_iforest' was fit to categorical data, must pass categorical data with the same number
*       of columns and the same category encoding.
* - ncols_categ
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Cannot be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - ncat
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Cannot be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - Xc[nnz]
*       Pointer to numeric data in sparse numeric matrix in CSC format (column-compressed).
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
*       Can only pass one of 'numeric_data' or 'Xc' + 'Xc_ind' + 'Xc_indptr'.
* - Xc_ind[nnz]
*       Pointer to row indices to which each non-zero entry in 'Xc' corresponds.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
* - Xc_indptr[ncols_numeric + 1]
*       Pointer to column index pointers that tell at entry [col] where does column 'col'
*       start and at entry [col + 1] where does column 'col' end.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
* - ndim
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Cannot be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - ntry
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - coef_type
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - sample_weights
*       Weights for the rows when adding this tree, either as sampling importances when using
*       sub-samples for each tree (i.e. passing weight '2' makes a row twice as likely to be included
*       in a random sub-sample), or as density measurement (i.e. passing weight '2' is the same as if
*       the row appeared twice, thus it's less of an outlier) - how this is taken is determined
*       through parameter 'weight_as_sample' that was passed to 'fit_iforest.
*       Pass NULL if the rows all have uniform weights.
* - nrows
*       Number of rows in 'numeric_data', 'Xc', 'categ_data'.
* - max_depth
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - limit_depth
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - penalize_range
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - col_weights
*       Sampling weights for each column, assuming all the numeric columns come before the categorical columns.
*       Ignored when picking columns by deterministic criterion.
*       If passing NULL, each column will have a uniform weight. Cannot be used when weighting by kurtosis.
* - weigh_by_kurt
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - prob_pick_by_gain_avg
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.

*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - prob_pick_by_gain_pl
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.

*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - new_cat_action
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Cannot be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.

*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
