\usage{
exactMatch(x, ...)

\S4method{exactMatch}{vector}(x, treatment)

\S4method{exactMatch}{formula}(x, data = NULL, subset = NULL, na.action = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A factor vector or a formula, used to select method.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for methods.}

\item{treatment}{A logical or binary vector the same length as \code{x}
indicating treatment and control for each unit in the study.
TRUE or 1 represents a treatment unit, FALSE or 0 represents
a control unit. NA units are excluded.}

\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} that contains the
variables used in the formula \code{x}.}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of
observations to be used}

\item{na.action}{A function which indicates what should happen when
the data contain `NA's}
}
\value{
A matrix like object, which is suitable to be given as
  \code{distance} argument to \code{\link{fullmatch}} or
  \code{\link{pairmatch}}. The exact match will be only zeros and
  \code{Inf} values, indicating a possible match or no possible
  match, respectively. It can be added to a another distance matrix
  to create a subclassed matching problem.
}
\description{
An exact match is one based on a factor. Within a level, all
observations are allowed to be matched. An exact match can be
combined with another distance matrix to create a set of matching
subproblems.
}
\details{
\code{exactMatch} creates a block diagonal matrix of 0s and
\code{Inf}s. The pairs with 0 entries are within the same level of
the factor and legitimate matches.  \code{Inf} indicates units in
different levels. \code{exactMatch} replaces the
\code{structure.fmla} argument to several functions in previous
versions of optmatch.  For the \code{factor} method, the two
vectors \code{x} and \code{treatment} must be the same length. The
vector \code{x} is interpreted as indicating the grouping factors
for the data, and the vector \code{treatment} indicates whether a
unit is in the treatment or control groups.  At least one of these
two vectors must have names.  For the \code{formula} method, the
\code{data} argument may be omitted, in which case the method
attempts to find the variables in the environment from which the
function was called. This behavior, and the arguments \code{subset}
and \code{na.action}, mimics the behavior of \code{\link{lm}}.

\examples{

data(nuclearplants)

### First generate a standard propensity score
ppty <- glm(pr~.-(pr+cost), family = binomial(), data = nuclearplants)
ppty.distances <- match_on(ppty)

### Only allow matches within the partial turn key plants
pt.em <- exactMatch(pr ~ pt, data = nuclearplants)
as.matrix(pt.em)

### Blunt matches:
match.pt.em <- fullmatch(pt.em)
print(match.pt.em, grouped = TRUE)

### Combine the propensity scores with the subclasses:
match.ppty.em <- fullmatch(ppty.distances + pt.em)
print(match.ppty.em, grouped = TRUE)
