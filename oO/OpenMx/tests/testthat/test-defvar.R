#Definition Variable Test 1

#This script is used to test the definition variable functionality in OpenMx
#The definition variable in this example is dichotomous, and describes two different groups
#These two groups are measured on two variables, x and y
#The group with a definition value of 1 has a covariance of 1 between x and y
#The group with a definition value of 0 has no relationship between x and y (beyond chance)
#The definition variable is then used to define the covariance between x and y

#make some data!
set.seed(200)
x1<-rnorm(500)
y1<-x1+rnorm(500, sd=1)

x2<-rnorm(500)
y2<-rnorm(500)+rnorm(500, sd=1)
n = 500

#put them both together, add a definition variable, and make an MxData object
x<-c(x1,x2)
y<-c(y1,y2)
def<-rep(c(1,0),each=500)
selvars<-c("x","y")


# Three covariance model matrices: 
#  "cov" for the zero relationship group
#  "def" for the definition variable, 
#   and "beta" for estimating difference between groups' covariances
# One common mean vector, "M"

#define the model, including a FIML objective function, which will optimize the matrix S
