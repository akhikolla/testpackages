March 4th, 2020 (0.6-1)

* Fix issue with upcoming R 4.0 which changes stringsAsFactors default
  to FALSE

* Fix issue with model outputs when EXNEX is being used. We recommend
  all users to upgrade to this version. The SBC runs now include
  checks for the per-group estimates to avoid a regression of the bug.
* Correct printing of prior information wrt. to summaries of number of
  strata and groups.

December 12th, 2019 (0.5-8)

* Merge data with same group and dosing in blrm_trial before passing
  into blrm_exnex for improved performance
* Ensure consistent sorting of this data to improve reproducibility of
  output with respect to input data permutations
* speedup Stan model which now skips data rows with no cases
* correct blrm_exnex documentation to reflect correctly exchangability
  model used for the interaction model

December 9th, 2019 (0.5-7)

* Improve numerical stability of log_inv_logit function, preventing
  NaNs in the output of pp_data and resulting errors in summary()

November 29th, 2019 (0.5-6)

* Support summary.blrm_trial(...) syntax passing into summary.blrmfit()

November 22nd, 2019 (0.5-5)

* Fixed Roxygen for posterior_predict

November 18th, 2019 (0.5-4)

* fix vignette documentation
* correct blrm trial co-data example
* fix test issues per CRAN checks on macosx-old-r run

November 15th, 2019 (0.5-3)

* new blrm_trial function which facilitates dose-escalation trial
  conduct by combining key trial design features
* new add_data argument to update function which adds data to existing
  model objects of class blrmfit or blrm_trial
* various smaller bug fixes

August 28th, 2019 (0.4-4)

* run in all examples the example code (remove dontrun sections)

August 27th, 2019 (0.4-3)

* use message instead of cat in functions using printing except
  summary or print
* suppress by default messages from Stan, can be enable with
  verbose=TRUE
* make examples run with very short sampling

August 27th, 2019 (0.4-2)

* Correct loading and exporting of methods
* Add tidybayes example for continuous use and visutalization of model
* Allow multiple central probability widths in prob argument of
  summary method

July 31st, 2019 (0.3-0)

* Correct external package loading in examples

July 27th, 2019 (0.2-0)

* Added function prior_summary
* Restructured print output
* Added examples single-agent, combo2 and combo3 along with example data sets
* A lot more documentation on reference pages
* New vignette on standard use case of blrm_exnex in Oncology
