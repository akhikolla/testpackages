\title{Identify nodes with most frequent membership in latent groups}
\usage{
\method{head}{mmsbm}(x, n = 6, t = NULL, node = TRUE, t.correct = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{mmsbm}, a result of a call to \code{mmsbm}.}

\item{n}{Numeric or integer; specifies how many units will be identified for each group.}

\item{t}{Optional vector of time periods to be used for assessing latent group membership.}

\item{node}{Logical; indicates whether latent group memberships should be averaged at the node level.  If FALSE, the function returns the node-time period units with highest estimated membership in each latent group.}

\item{t.correct}{Logical; indicates whether latent group memberships should be corrected for temporal trends.  If TRUE, the function returns the node-time period units with highest estimated membership in each latent group.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored}
}
\value{
List of length \code{n.blocks}.  Each entry contains a sorted vector of average latent membership probabilities of length \code{n}.
}
\description{
The function lists the nodes (optionally, node-time periods) that most frequently instantiate membership in each latent group.
